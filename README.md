2020, the year of pandemic and uncertainity, saw unprecedented levels of volatility. VIX, CBOE Volatility Index, sometimes reffered to as "fear index", hit its all-time high on 16 March ðŸ’¸ [1]. This, along with major societal changes caused by COVID-19 [2] and significant media coverage of financial markets, caused the raise of retail investors ðŸ“ˆ [3][4]. The individual investors ðŸ’» (non-professional market participants) account for over 20% of traded equity [5][6], and the knowledge of their movements became an object of great interest for big investors [7].
