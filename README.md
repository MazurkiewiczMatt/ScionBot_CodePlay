2020, the year of pandemic and uncertainity, saw unprecedented levels of volatility. VIX, CBOE Volatility Index, sometimes reffered to as "fear index" [1], hit its all-time high on 16 March. This, along with major societal changes caused by COVID-19 [2] and significant media coverage of financial markets, caused the raise of retail investors [3][4].
