2020, the year of pandemic and uncertainity, saw unprecedented levels of volatility on stock market. VIX, CBOE Volatility Index, sometimes reffered to as "fear index", hit its all-time high on 16 March ðŸ’¸ [1]. This, along with major societal changes caused by COVID-19 [2] and significant media coverage of financial markets, caused the raise of retail investors ðŸ“ˆ [3][4]. The individual investors ðŸ’» (non-professional market participants) account for over 20% of traded equity [5][6], and the knowledge of their movements became an object of great interest for big investors [7].

Some attempts have been made at quantizing the retail investors' sentiment. Mjysong's [Momentum Trading off Sentiment from r/wallstreetbets](https://medium.com/@mjysong/momentum-trading-off-sentiment-from-r-wallstreetbets-149c19c7538d) article on Medium describes one such inquiry. The author attempts to evaluate post on [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) ðŸ’µ, 1.6 million strong financial community on social media site Reddit, by whether they represent bullish ðŸ“ˆ or bearish ðŸ“‰ sentiment. He creates a dictionary of 200 words of subreddit's subculture, which he uses to calculate Bull/Bear ratio from 25 most-commented threads.
