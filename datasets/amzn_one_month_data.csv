1,2020-09-16,g5h1okf,TheMitraBoy,investing,"The primary use case for buying Snowflake is replatforming legacy data warehouses to the cloud. One of the biggest challenges in this process is feature parity between the source and the destination. 

Both Snowflake and Amazon's Redshift are built on top of Postgres. Snowflake is miles ahead of Redshift and Bigquery in terms of feature parity with popular legacy data warehouses. The only real competition is Microsoft's product, Synapse. 

Snowflake isn't really built on top of any of the cloud providers. It just happens to run on their infrastructure which gives the customer freedom to move from one cloud vendor to the other with minimal effort. 

In fact, the feature gap between Snowflake and Bigquery is so much that it might make a Snowflake an excellent acquisition target in the future, like Looker. But that seems to be a stretch for now."
2,2020-09-16,g5gxtzu,MullFitMan,investing,"I would disagree with the last part, as AWS continues to grow, my guess is that Amazon Redshift would see and increase in the total addressable market, and not necessarily Snowflake.  


Snowflake is built on top of Google Cloud, Amazon, and Microsoft Azure, and it's more expensive in the long run than Redshift and Google's BigQuery.  


Google, Amazon, and Microsoft have their own systems that compete directly with Snowflake, and Snowflake is using their services to run their systems. So not only do they have well-established competition, they're also at the mercy of price changes, or any issues with their competitors' data centers, since they're using them and not their own.  


I just don't like the long-term prospects of a company that built its product directly on top of their competitors' products, and then tries to compete with them."

0,2020-09-16,g5fh5i1,lurkkkknnnng2,options,"Yeah, PTON’s moves are in large part due to speculation. Just like UPS and FDX are at risk of disruption by Amazon, PTON is at risk of a bigger better tech company with a better user base, say Apple, slapping an iPad on a better bike, putting it out there and poof, PTON becomes another yahoo. UPS and Fedex have legitimate fundamentals and infrastructure though. I don’t really care about 30%. It’s not worth the stress of holding something like this through sideways volatility and protective sell offs."
0,2020-09-16,g5gz1ya,ClimbAndMaintain0116,StockMarket,"I just read the New York Times article. I believe there’s a few reasons people may still believe in Nikola:

1. The damaging claim was made by a short seller who has financial interest in the share price falling.

2. They obtained a massive investment from General Motors. They make sure to do their due diligence before throwing a huge number of dollars at an investment. They aren’t the typical Robinhood investor who invests on a whim of news, they make sure they are investing in something real.

In fact, the GM Chief Executive literally said “We’ve done our due diligence and are staying in the deal.”

3. The business plan itself. If this is just a phase and Hindenburg wasn’t correct, then major corporations like Amazon have already made plans to reduce their emissions in a few years. One giant contract like that would make this $30 share price one hell of a deal.

1,2020-09-16,g5fq3g4,neothedreamer,StockMarket,"I think you are thinking about this wrong. A trailing stoploss of 20% means you lost 20% of your investment already. If you are invested in quality stocks please explain how you would lose everything.  Do you see Amazon, Msft, Aapl going to $0 in any conditions that wouldn't be end of days for almost everything. I have used Stoplosses on occasion and it almost always seems like when they trigger it is at the bottom right before a stock starts recovering.

 I have found the only reliable way to control your portfolio is to actively sell stock after an unusual up day or run.  For example Netflix recently ran up to $535 or so and I sold because there was no basis for it. You then watch for a correction and buy back in.  If you are worried about a big drop and just want to sleep better put a trailing % stop loss of like 8 to 12% depending on the stock and its volatility and be prepared to be angry when it triggers and the stock moves back up almost immediately.

Some stocks like Amzn and Nvda have been running up pretty consistently so I would be very hesitant to use a stop loss."

You might see some volatility so don't worry if it dips a little lower. A few percent doesnt mean anything if you are in it for the long run.

Amazon is also one I like a lot. Huge potential for ripping growth. Wide net, lots of innovation. Everyone uses it and it's the gold standard against which all other online shopping is compared. I always joke about AmazonTown being a thing in the future if they ever get into real estate.

I like SQ in the long run. Illumina makes some really cool futuristic stuff. Of course Amazon is a killer stock to own if you can afford the price tag. Probably the safest stock to own long term. BABA is a nice pick as an alternative as well, probably the best Chinese company in terms of following the law and being transparent, not engaging in any fraud or sketchy behavior etc."
13,2020-09-16,g5h2ojj,3headed__monkey,stocks,"I responded to this in a different thread. Snowflake is great, they have top-notch veteran engineers, their product is also top-notch. But this is how it goes generally:

A company that is not making any profit yet. They have one single source of revenue which is the data warehouse. 2-3 years back, the gap between Snowflake & Amazon Redshift was huge, so the majority of the time (or most of the time) Snowflake won in every single competitive situation. Fast-forward 2-3 years, Redshift narrowed the gap. Still, Snowflake is better but not like before. Companies like Amazon, Azure, GCP have resources, $, a lot of time they don't have the right product, to begin with, but they put all their resources and some time even they copy-paste competitor's product feature.

On the other hand, many of those veteran engineers will move (that's what they do, they go for the next challenge), they will also do dilution. While they are doing that, competitors will keep narrowing the gap, and big enterprises prefer to go with biggies when they don't see much feature difference, also they love credit which Snowflakes cannot offer at that scale.

Remember Hortonworks or Cloudera? A few years back, companies used to go with Cloudera, Hortonworks (for their Hadoop platforms) and they didn't pick Amazon EMR or Azure HDInsight as the gap was huge. Now, it's completely a different picture. It's really hard to compete with FAANG!

Again, I'm not saying what happened with Cloudera/Hortonworks, will happen with Snowflake. But this is a common pattern."

2,2020-09-17,g5kxrkd,elus,investing,"Like I mentioned Amazon has Redshift already and that operates in a similar space.

Snowflake has some good tech but many of the whitepapers/journal articles that it's derived from are available online. And Amazon puts out a lot of their own research. There's no reason to steal when that knowledge is actually available to all.

Snowflake will need to grow by an enormous amount before they're worth acquiring by the big boys and any acquisition will mostly be a defensive move to blunt them from taking too big of a market share.

They had about 4k clients with revenues of about 70k/yr each. That's not much at all when you're looking at companies with these kinds of market caps.

And data warehouse implementations are typically incredibly complex undertakings."

8,2020-09-17,g5kit9b,JeffB1517,investing,"Redshift is designed to simplify Amazon's management.  It is much much cheaper but offers a bundle price for compute and storage.  Essentially Redshift is sold as if it were an opensource datawarehouse and Amazon were a hosting company leasing you hardware.  Snowflake cloud scales and autoscales.  That means the users within the company hosting on Snowflake don't need to negotiate between themselves how to chop up the computation load, each can buy as much as they want, use what the want when they want.  A vastly simpler, though more expensive, way to do data warehousing.  Essentially Snowflake is really cloud based while Redshift (interestingly) isn't nearly as cloud based.

Also Snowflake's GUI does a better job with managing lots of warehouses so again a company ends up with lots of warehouses managed lower down in the company and avoids complex internal negotiations."

Absolutely agree. Although, some tech companies that have been around for a while have been stopping new customer engagements.

> But that doesn't tell me anything about the company as an investor. Plenty of people left FB/Google/AMZN to work for Uber, Lyft, Snapchat, etc. Uber was offering $220k base and $1M+ total RSU packages a year before their IPO to lure away good Google engineers. I have seen senior engineer offers from SNAP that included $1.5M RSU packages. These high profile unicorn companies always pay extremely well, but that is not a leading indicator of their business, let alone stock performance.

Good point! Yeah there's not much difference from the other big tech companies in terms of salary currently but it's definitely competitive. Huge stock options and packages before IPO that were worth a lot before. Most tech companies definitely did the same and used those packages to lure employees.

> I do believe SNOW is a fantastic company that is definitely doing many things right. The last company their CEO took public was ServiceNow, now the 2nd largest SAAS company.

As an investor, I would not put any money in right now. All the institutions are going crazy over this with tons of money pouring. I would wait until the price consolidates and not to chase the stock even if it keeps going up tomorrow. It's going to correct but once it corrects I expect a nice gradual climb. Their revenue and growth annually is pretty amazing and Snowflake isn't restricted to just one aspect of a business either, their customers may have other needs than data warehousing and Snowflake could easily provide that.

>Employees from Facebook, Google, and Amazon have actually left to come work for snowflake. Pay is much better at snowflake and their recruitment team is incredible.

Their salary is a bit below the big tech last time I checked but yes, their RSU packages would be worth a lot now due to the IPO explosion. If you got a $400k RSU package at $60/share pre-IPO as a senior engineer it would be worth close to $2M now. That would definitely exceed an average L5/E5's comp at Google/FB.

Google BigQuery and Amazon Redshift prove that this is a sexy area especially since they've been pushing these cloud based solutions HARD and theyve seen them as integral to their growth. 

Furthermore, Google and Amazon have clearly tried to hire Snowflake folks and failed pretty hard. 

That said, Google Cloud is floundering. It really hasn't been able to build SI partnerships effectively and its offering is seen with serious suspicion by CISOs. 

Amazon's toxic culture has also hampered its recruitment. In addition, in a number of industries (healthcare, insurance, retail, large tech), Amazon is a competitor which works against it when there is a viable alternative.

Some facts. 

- Their main competitors: teradata, and amazon redshift are being left in the dust in terms of data warehousing. Customers are leaving redshift and terradata for snowflake.

- They can afford to undercut prices because their software engineers have created an amazing data warehousing product that the account managers can rely on to do most of the work. I'm a certified Amazon AWS Architect and SnowPRO Core certified. I've worked with both products and Snowflake blows Amazon Redshift out of the park.

- You know how most companies have had to scale down operations because of Covid? Exact opposite for snowflake. All employees are still working from home and and engaging with customers like nothing has happened.

- Employees from Facebook, Google, and Amazon have actually left to come work for snowflake. Pay is pretty good at snowflake and their recruitment team is incredible.

- Most tech companies have partner companies that they branch out with. In snowflake, you have to PAY to become a partner. That’s right. And the partner companies are doing pretty well and making snowflake a good amount of income.

There’s a lot more but I’m on mobile. You can downvote me but know it’s not going to get bought out or sold anytime soon. They’re absolutely killing it in what they do currently and are looking to branch out. Amazon used to be a shopping website and it does much more than that now. Google used to be a search engine and it does more than that now. My opinion is that it’s going to do a lot more than data warehousing in the future.


EDIT: Salary and bonuses are more or less about the same as the big tech companies currently especially Post IPO."
24,2020-09-17,g5khk9p,JeffB1517,investing,"I don't think the stock is worth $60 a share.  But a good deal of your post is trashing the product.  So I'll respond to that.  

Snowflake was one of the first if fully cloud native database engines.  This means that workloads become simple companies don't have to make complex tradeoffs between their aggregate workloads and instead can price each thing they want to do individually.   What they offer is simplicity of decision making and extraordinary ability to scale.  There are competitors  among those early players the first to get the balance right. So today Sept 2020 they offer for many the best balance of simplicity, least buggy and feature rich for most companies looking to get into virtual data warehousing.  They are quickly becoming the default choice for good reasons.  You are simply wrong they don't have a product they most certainly do.  It is well liked and heavily in use.  

Amazon and Google the two companies you named are if they decide to compete directly, which I don't think they will, would be playing catch up with them.  More likely Amazon, Microsoft, Google.. will just continue to make money selling underlying compute and storage to Snowflake which then resells this as part of their product.  

In terms of roadmap, the roadmap is pretty obvious.  Multi and hybrid cloud, better no-sql integration (like yugobyte), big data integration (DataStax), more complex handling of frames.  And then of course the host of enterprise security and management features in say an Oracle or DB2 (IBM's more traditional product).  From there they can start moving up the value chain into areas like ERP (SAP, Oracle, Infor...).  Being able to run scaleable  planning could benefit tremendously from fully cloud native engines as right now these jobs can still tie up a chunk of the system for 3 days / month and thus planning is constrained.  SAP has always been database neutral and and Infor has gone cloud native so they could build or partner.  

Now that being said.   Oracle is what they can grow into if they are lucky. Oracle's market cap is $185b. They are currently priced at 40% of Oracle's market cap and I think if they do a very good job they are still 20 years from being an Oracle.  I'm not sure how much of the IPO money went sideways and how much went into Snowflake but if even a fraction did they just got a huge R&D and/or sales/market budget.  So I see a few more years of fast growth at least.  

I wouldn't buy the stock.  But the product is quality.  It deserves to have an IPO.  And there is nothing wrong with the stock except the price is ridiculous."

Yep, stocks in the same sector tend to move together. AMZN and ETSY aren't cloud, but they're ecom.

For the same reasons, I strongly recommend against selling SHOP here. It's a great company with a big future. It's green today when SPY is dying, which means it'll probably be back to $1000 as soon as the market starts cooperating. 

The absolute max I can see SPY dropping to is 320. After that we'll start ripping and you'll regret selling.

Plus, the UK just announced that they're in a second covid wave. So have a bunch of EU countries. Imagine how that will impact covid stocks like SHOP."

Even without the deal, the company has business with big names already and is increasing production/sales through the end of the year. Already have a deal with UPS for trucks, and there's lots of potential for other great contracts aside from USPS. (Either Amazon or Walmart is the biggest name, I can't remember which). 3. They have a 10% stake in Lordstown Motors (DPHC), another booming OH company producing electric trucks. DPHC also has great growth potential and will be able to assist WKHS in EV production with their recently acquired manufacturing plant from GM. 

I'm 21 and first started investing through RH in April. I'm up 60%, partly due to WKHS. This is a stock I could see myself holding until I retire. Next decade at least will be all EV. I know I'm new to the game and I don't know what I don't know, but I study Econ at UMich and am going into investing after graduating. I don't think a $250 stock price in 2-5 years is very far out of the picture. Do some reading for yourself, but I have a lot of confidence in WKHS even without the USPS contract."

In a nutshell, the stock market exists to get money from people who are willing to exchange cash for units ownership of a company. In the process, if earnings of companies show a positive trajectory, the share prices could or should rise with the earnings increasing. The stock market does get out of control with how it can go up and up in prices like we saw with Tesla, Amazon, Apple, etc. stocks recently and then it will dive in prices and throw everything away at once like we saw in this past March. If you are willing to buy a broad index of stocks and keep buying shares of them via an index mutual fund, in the long run they should mirror the growth that economic output produces. That is easy to say, but along the way a lot of things can happen to discourage people from holding onto the stocks they purchased."
6,2020-09-18,g5p0oq0,thenewredditguy99,StockMarket,">Let's say I buy 2000 stocks (whatever that is)

A stock is a share in a company that represents partial ownership, and a claim on future earnings. 

>Then over 2-5 years the company grows to become one of the largest internet providers in Australia. This means the company net worth increase. If the net worth increase, the worth of my stocks increase, say from $1 each (which I bought them for) to $1.20. This means if I sell my stocks now, it'll be worth $2400. That means I have made a profit of $400. Is that right?

Net worth is a personal term, not corporate. If the 2000 shares of stock in the company you own go up to $1.20/share, yes, you will have made a profit of $400, but that profit is not officially yours until you sell it. 

 

>Is that how the stock marker works? And does that mean to make lots of money you have to spend lots of money? Like it's not like my $2000 can become $5000? That's too much of a gain right? Or is it possible if the company becomes successful.

Pretty much, yes. Ditto for the make a lot of money-spend a lot of money. 

Your initial investment of $2000 can turn into $5000 if the company's share price increases enough. I mean, people who believed in Amazon when they went public 23 years ago were rewarded handsomely with a split-adjusted basis 173,815.03% ROI. 

>The reason I am here is just that I considered to get into the market so that I can make some extra money while I study as a veterinarian and work part time as a cashier. But if the profit is only 20% then the risk is too high, but if the profit is 150% Then we're talking. Am I being naive?

It sounds like you are relatively young, so you have years ahead of you to ride out the ups and downs of the market. Risk is ideal for you right now, because you have decades ahead of you. But as you get closer to retirement, you'll gradually want to begin reducing your stock exposure and replacing it with bond exposure"

0,2020-09-19,g5s4kw4,ThemChecks,investing,"Amazon wasn't a solid firm back then though. It took a while.

Reversion to the mean is a bit misunderstood. At worst case, a stock may revert to more fundamentally sound valuations, but the dot com problem mostly came about because unprofitable companies or companies that were far and away valued beyond they could be worth. Amazon took a large chunk out of retail and wound up doing well in internet services. Lots of companies had stocks based on nothing that turned out to be worth just that.

I do think pricing stocks for the next 100 years is pretty crazy. P/E is important. But people flock to profitable companies for a reason and no good stock ever traded at a P/E of 1.

My favorite BDC is at a P/E of 121 and I doubt that signifies anything bad due to how it is structured. P/E can also just signify that earnings may be low now but may be much higher in a few years. Tesla's 1000 year P/E right now may be P/E of 500 in a few years, etc.. not the best example but you won't find intrinsically valued stock. Only fair market value stock. Even undervalued stocks trade at P/E that look years down the road."

At no time should your investment make you lose sleep. If you are at that stage, sell!

There's the bullish argument that Ryan Cohen (CHWY dude who set up profitable e-commerce niche from scratch) will either be a massive activist and turn it into the ""CHWY"" of videogames. That's what the long GME play is, but I'm just in it for the short squeeze or short burn. And, it's more likely that Ryan Cohen will just send out a tender offer (still triggers a short squeeze) so it won't matter if GME will really be worth $100+ per share as it will be privately owned by then. For comparison, CHWY is worth over $20 billion right now on quarterly revenues of $1.6 billion. He's a pro on making large-scale fulfillment centers, and there's definitely a hole to be filled as Amazon is slowly losing its e-commerce dominance (e.g. Amazon isn't doing same-day delivery on non-essential things anymore).

Did you know Gamestop sells digital PC and digital console games through their platform? Did you know the vast majority of the PS5 preorders were still disk systems? There's a lot of small developments around Gamestop recently where it's turning out to be more like Netflix comeback rather than Blockbuster bankruptcy that makes it a fun speculation play given it's still a value pick. It's hilarious that so many people just assume Gamestop is going bankrupt without doing any DD on it at all because they have this negative bias against (probably because they got ripped off on trading in their used games as a kid), but there's no denying their massive brand presence can be leveraged to do so many things."

0,2020-09-21,g62xeyr,dvdmovie1,investing,"This should go in the daily advice thread, but I'll offer a few thoughts here:

1. The more aggressive you get, the more I think one has to constantly reassess risk tolerance and portfolio risk. 

2. I'd be more opportunistic and look to really become aggressive during bigger declines/opportunities instead of just continually adding over time.

3. There are a number of good/very aggressive growth ETFs (the Ark funds) and mutual funds (some of the Baron Funds and the two Zevenbergen Funds) but the issue does become these are very aggressive funds and there's going to be great years (like this year has largely been for these funds) and bad years and the bad years are going to be rough. The Zevenbergen (https://www.forbes.com/sites/antoinegara/2017/10/03/nancy-zevenbergen-investor-tesla-amazon-netflix-best-investor/, ""Meet The Best Investor You've Never Heard Of: Why She Stuck With Amazon, Netflix And Tesla For Years"") and Ark funds in particular are what I call ""swing for the fences"" growth funds - hyper aggressive. I'd really be very patient with adding funds like that and look to take advantage of opportunities, definitely not adding into strength. It's a bit easier to have a long-term view when you have a low cost basis.

4. Individual names do allow one to make more specific bets on various growth themes, so something to consider but if you're looking really entirely for set it and forget it it's funds.

5. I wouldn't have your entire portfolio be  hyper aggressive growth; maybe you have a portion in the Ark or Zevenbergen funds and the rest is a mixture of more standard growth funds/ETFs and maybe some sturdy dividend growth (T. Rowe Price Dividend Growth, perhaps.) I can understand wanting to focus on hyper growth, but when hyper growth is not in favor you're going to be happy you have some stability and when stability is not in favor you're going to be happy you have hyper growth."

You could take a company, lower the global overnight rate, accelerate trends that help the company grow (COVID helped tech), and start reinvesting revenue instead of distributing it and you’ve got the same company making the same amount of money as before but PE will likely rise a lot"
4,2020-09-21,g65dlks,ryry1237,investing,Imo this time is actually completely the same as all previous situations. Low interest rates benefits growth companies. Stay at home orders benefits companies that capitalize on the situation. Economic uncertainty benefits large cap companies with wide moats. Amazon is a company that benefits from all 3 (though admittedly the run-up may have overshot like all market situations do).

I would assume that once you get that rich, your money has to protect itself. Essentially, you can’t just toss money around here and there because of the leveraging and loans you have in place. I mean surely the richest people in the world wouldn’t get where they are without having debt. I wonder who’s the richest in the world as far as cold hard cash goes. Even assets are subjective.

Larger rewards.

If you buy a REIT you cannot affect the outcome yourself.  However, if you are wealthy and you buy a building, you likely have influence that can get it rezoned or a zoning exception to build something there that others couldn't.  It may cost you making substantial campaign contributions to half of the city council, but thats just the cost of doing business.

Another possibility, perhaps you know from your friend that owns a construction company that he has just been hired to build the new Amazon office in the city and you know where because he told you.  You have another person you know that has a warehouse property not far away they want to unload.  You buy the warehouse on the cheap, flatten it, and build a luxury high rise which is at 100% occupancy even before the construction finishes.  You can't do that in an REIT.

The wealthy likely DO have some boring S&P500 index funds and the like, but they also have more money above that.  Thats the money you're seeing them use for exotic investments."

1,2020-09-23,g6b6lmi,2BNierMe,stocks,"Without going into a book load of historical, economic, and educational disabilities that hamper the vast majority of working Americans from ""taking advantage"" of that $10000 stock deal and others like it, I'll just get straight to the point.

Many people either don't have the money to spare to afford $5,000 much less $10,000 extra cash to invest and they don't have the experience or skills to know which company out of tens of thousands listed is a good buy and which one is overpriced and going to crash 80% in value in the next hour.

The oligarchs you worship as heroes are parasites.  Once upon a time MAYBE they got rich through hard work (Apple Steve Jobs certainly deserves this credit but Bill Gates was quite the thief with his stealing intellectual data and Zuckerberg is not far behind), but in the vast majority of oligarch backgrounds they inherited the cash from Daddy.  Just ask our esteemed President who only got a measly $1 million (or was it $10 million?) from Daddy when he died and somehow ran up debts of over $1 billion and counting.

However the problem is they have made too much money to the point they now control public policy and regulatory capture.  They essentially prevent other hard working creative people from following after their ""examples"" (for the self made billionaire) with anti-competitive measures, buy outs, new regs and laws passed by their bought and paid for congressmen and judges, and basically a shit load of bureaucracy, anti-competition, and harassment to destroy any potential threat to their monopoly status.

I am not against people making money, I happen to like that money myself.  But I am against idiots who think they are Zeus and have a greed that can fill 10 Black Holes while simultaneously running the country and the economy to shit.

If you saw the news today as an investor you should see the stock market is a schizophrenic who is ODing on heroin mixed with crack-meth and getting a whiskey enema at the same time.  Normally it is supposed to be affected by market forces and not precisely predictable by anyone.  But with our good friend Powell at the helm, the publicly open shameless insider trading all these Robin Hood investors and pump and dumpers are doing messing with market fundamentals and showing a Physics equation that ""What goes up just keeps going up and sometimes down while going up"" and all big companies deciding fuck the customer demand and market forces and Business 101 we'll just keep borrowing from the Fed ad infinitum and become not just the Walking Dead but the Walking Dead driving a Lamborgini while doing speed.

When shit hits the fan, you cannot plead ignorance.  I warned everyone but I should not have to.

>It's a challenge to list all the reasons this is a flawed idea, even  setting aside the lunacy of seizing people's assets to give to other  people.

The video from Prof. Wolff completely negates your criticisms, watch his presentation and then try to find the flaws there.  Go on.  One fact you forgot to mention is how Bezos, Musk, Buffett are all the biggest ass welfare queens this side of Davos.  How many billions or trillions in tax breaks, subsidies, special favors, free press, you name it do these moochers get from Washington just from Coronavirus bailouts not even speaking of the history of decades of government welfare their companies suck out faster than a cheap porno?  These are OUR tax dollars these companies legally steal through ~~bribes~~ lobbying and unfair competition (most of the local shops in my town got closed up and turned into a ghetto because Amazon and Walmart and Dollar store outbid them on price).  And those people who lost their businesses and jobs?  They're not coming back economically speaking; soup lines are a mile long not just due to the pandemic and there has been year on year of drug overdoses and suicide.  And this is happening now in downtown NYC, LA, and San Fran so its not so easy to turn a blind eye and bury your head in the sand like the ""good old days.""

&#x200B;

>Who would ever start a new company? What if someone starts a company and  hires one employee? Does the owner end up with nothing, because the one  employee has to be given all the stock?  When Amazon hires someone new,  do all current employees have to hand over part of their stock to the  new person? What if someone quits? Do they have to give up their stock?

Every company has to start by borrowing shitloads of investment capital from banks, lending companies, friends or family.  If the workers all own a piece of the company EVERYONE chips in their own money because if this company crashes and dies that happens to be YOUR JOB that just got destroyed and unless you think waiting long lines at the unemployment office and writing a hundred resumes is a fun thing to do, I think most Americans like to KEEP their jobs and protect it.  Its not charity, its self interest and putting food on the table for those 3 kids and their future college tuitions, and mortgage and all that jazz.  Most of the investors here in this forum are trading to get some extra cash for that retirement or pay for that vacation house or mortgage or whatever because you NEED the money.  Unless Carl Icahn or Warren Buffett also posts here I assume people do not want to do stupid things to destroy their own nest egg and livelihood.

Oh and for the A-holes that think they can just own a chunk of the company and not contribute well that's what a vote to fire the lazy parasite is for.  Only difference is the ""Boss"" who fires you are the OTHER WORKERS who vote it out.  So if you do something that makes you look bad or hurt other people don't count on being Bill Gates' son or the CEO's son-in-law to give you that immunity power.  And if you leave the company you have to sell the shares to everyone else, you make money and you get your company pension too.  And for newbies that join they can buy their equal share on a loan and work off the next 10-15 years to pay off the loan on their shares.  This is a foolproof safety mechanism to make sure we don't get job hoppers who land and quit in a day to abuse the system.

Besides there is a thing called COMMON SENSE.  A mom and pop convenience store or the hardworking immigrant's takeout restaurant is exempt.  If you read what I mentioned before I was saying something about the Fortune 500.  If you limit the reforms I advocate to the Fortune 500 or the 500 richest companies (all worth millions, billions, or trillions for Apple and Microsoft, etc) then the only people who are paying are the ones at the top of this pyramid Ponzi Scheme.  Of course if that mom and pop shop somehow expanded all over the country and made over a billion dollars to jump into that Fortune 500 category they have to be accountable to the public because their business has a significant effect on many thousands or millions of people.  The owners still have a LOT of money, they can always work out a sell their shares agreement to the employees.  So there is still financial incentive to work hard.  The only difference is for example look at Bezos.  He got about $30 billion in govt welfare from the Coronavirus bailout alone.  He already has $100-200 billion dollars yet he needed an extra 30 to round that off.  If you reduce his total net worth down to a cool $100-200 million he is still super rich and will not need to live in a homeless shelter but all that money can go to people like [Barbara Chandler](https://www.benzinga.com/news/20/06/16176684/lawsuit-filed-after-amazon-warehouse-worker-fatally-infects-cousin-with-coronavirus) who worked in a Amazon warehouse and got sick with COVID and infected her cousin who died.

Elon Musk's Tesla is almost 100% dependent on Govt bailout, contracts, and subsidies.  I recall reading how many times this ""successful"" company almost went bankrupt were it not for that sweet sweet federal contract which ironically made him a star for investors because he became a super welfare queen.  I won't even go into how Buffett, Gates, Walmart, all the other oligarchs suck off the Govt so much I wonder why they don't just go public and support legalized prostitution.  It is the world's oldest profession and these losers all practice it which is frankly disgusting when you think about how old and ugly these cretins are and the congressmen and senators and President they must be uhh doing ""private favors"" for.

So unless you think it is absolutely essential to give extra billions to already rich dudes who collectively ran the economy into a grave and frankly are just a larger and longer running version of Enron and how the US has several hundred thousand that will die from COVID and still no coherent public health policy or money to help the people getting desperate on the streets then perhaps its time for a change.  And the best place to start that change is where the source of the Disease is: Wall Street.  Occupy Wall St wasn't enough the whole system needs top down dismantlement and reform.

Everyone here should be calling their brokerage and demand what I suggested give all the Fortune 500 shares to their employees and do it yesterday pal.  If they dont people should go on a ""Stock strike"" where they refuse to buy or sell or just sell off everything whatever messes up the company's stock portfolio, consider it Investment Civil Disobedience and demand a COMMUNIST MARKET in Wall St once and for all!  We are all proletariat now and I think its a smart idea to join the winning side here.  Have you taken a look outside your office windows and noticed all those bread lines and unemployment lines waiting outside?  This is a slow motion train wreck that is still trudging along and ready to run off a cliff."
3,2020-09-22,g678fh8,thatburghfan,stocks,"> Have all the employees of 100% of the companies trading right now own all the stocks. Get the government to do an asset seizure and redistribute all shares of Google, Apple, Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway, etc to everyone from temp workers, contractors, and janitors

When Amazon hires someone new, do all current employees have to hand over part of their stock to the new person? What if someone quits? Do they have to give up their stock? 

I certainly don't see any value in an economic structure where someone can risk everything to start a company, grow it, have it succeed, then have their ownership taken away and given to the employees.

On the investing side, the worst example you could have cited was Madoff. Any serious investor had all the knowledge necessary to avoid being scammed. You don't accept brokerage statements that aren't from a custodian.  Greedy people get careless."

Which is why blood lettings should be taken as an opportunity for those in it for the longish haul.  AMZN is an example of one that I believe will basically crush it this fall/winter given Covid's going nowhere til at least end of year (and likely not til early-mid next) + cold and flu season is approaching.  Online shopping is basically going to own Black Friday & X-mas season.  Yet AMZN is still ~15% off the price just a few weeks ago right now."
38,2020-09-22,g675deb,SCBbestof,stocks,"It's called ""greenwashing"". Look it up.

A lot of companies (I would say most) do it. Even ExxonMobil claims they are going for a green future. It's an usual practice to paint your company green on your own website and even to allocate money for some initiatives in order to greenify your image.

Take this example, although it's not greenwashing, billionaires like Bezos donating 100k per year to various causes. That's 0.00000000057% of its wealth. He makes more than that in less than an hour.

There are even some industrials like painting themselves green for using solar power in their offices. Volkswagen with their ""clean diesel"" and so on..."

Which market? If you have no time limit, if the S&P is your market benchmark, Nasdaq will eventually beat it. And AMZN will likely beat Nasdaq. If nobody beats the average returns of the market, then Wall St wouldn't have produced so many billionaires."

Idk let's say $1000 for the sake of it. If the price jumps to 3500 you exercise and buy them (all 100) for 3300 apiece. You just made $20,000 profit minus the 1000 premium you paid.

If it doesnt reach 3300 you wont exercise because that would be dumb to pay more. You're just out the original 1000."

Additionally, even Amazon, I dare say, has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the pandemic and will likely benefit if Amazon Day and Black Friday take off spectacularly. The latter especially could push one of the biggest shopping seasons online and this will happen if the winter pandemic worsens.

What are your views? Thanks!"
8,2020-09-23,g6aiwno,neothedreamer,investing,"If you are under 30 completely ignore bonds. Your time horizon to retirement is 35 to 45 years. Sometimes holding is the best choice.

Investing if ETFs is not necessarily diversifying.  You should look at the top 10 holdings in each. You may be surprised to know that the top 4 or 5 holdings in the S&P and Nasdaq indexss are the same stocks - Aapl, Msft, FB, Amazon, Goog.

I went to individual stocks because I have way more control.  Do you research.  Paper trade.  Go create a hit list of 10 to 20 stocks you would be willing to buy and figure out a price where you would buy them probably about 20% less than the ATH.  This is right around where Aapl, NVDA, AMD, MSFT etc are right now."
0,2020-09-24,g6f4pwg,sonacarl,StockMarket,"Literally just yesterday if you had bought Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google, you would have underperformed the S&P 500 from a 1 day return. My point isn’t that a one day return should indicate how you should invest. It is that given the volume of buyers in the stock market, the laws of supply and demand, if Apple outperforms the S&p500 at 12% per year and s&p 500 performs at 10% forever, investors will pile their money into Apple and have an opportunity of arbitrage (gain at zero risk). 

However what happens in the market is that once mass numbers of investors see that Apple has abnormal returns, they pile their money into it until it returns to normal returns again. This is the theory, and over an extremely long time frame, it is suspected to hold. This is a combination of the “weak form efficient market hypothesis” and the laws of supply and demand and arbitrage. The market isn’t completely efficient, and when inefficiencies are spotted, some people can capitalize on those short term inefficiencies. And outperform the S&P 500."
1,2020-09-23,g6bhp5e,RunningJay,StockMarket,"Of course you need to buy them ""before"" they become winners.  I think we may have missed the 1,000% gains from AAPL but I still expect them to outperform the S&P.  Same with AMZN.

I bought them both in 2019 when AAPL was at all-time high and AMZN was 20% off highs.

&#x200B;

My point is there is a trade-off with indexes, sometimes you get allocations in areas you don't want (e.g. DOW has had investments in oil and gas which I have zero interest in).

Indexes work for most, but you'll never beat the market if that's all you own.  


Personally I have about 40% of my portfolio in indexes - SPY, MGK and some others but by far and away my growth has come from my individual stocks."

It's easy to look back and say, I only need X,Y, or Z stocks, they're clear winners after the fact. Now that AMZN, etc.. have made it big, the expectation that they're going to continue driving market returns goes down. They might still continue to be well run highly profitable companies, but their future earnings become more expensive for investors and become ""priced in"" as they say.



I mean, I remember one year, was it 2016? I cant remember exactly, *dominoes pizza* drove market returns, in an era of tech stonks who would have predicted *dominoes pizza* to be the break out stock."

You make it sound like its so easy to pick and choose the best performers, but as someone pointed out here yesterday or today, [Dominos Pizza outperformed Amazon from 2009 to present](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=2009&firstMonth=1&endYear=2020&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&showYield=false&reinvestDividends=true&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=DPZ&allocation1_1=100&symbol2=AMZN&allocation2_2=100). How many of us have been loaded up on Dominos for the last 12 years.

There were many periods that [Electronic Arts was far more profitable to be invested in than Microsoft](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=1985&firstMonth=1&endYear=2020&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&showYield=false&reinvestDividends=true&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=EA&allocation1_1=100&symbol2=msft&allocation2_2=100). That is also old news, [Microsoft has flown away valuation wise](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=2008&firstMonth=1&endYear=2020&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&showYield=false&reinvestDividends=true&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=EA&allocation1_1=100&symbol2=msft&allocation2_2=100).

Literally every equity investment manager in the world is striving to pick the best companies out there, as are all of the rest of us. The thing is, we only know who the strongest performers will be with hindsight. I can't go back in time and buy EA in the 90's, but if i'd bought at the start of 2008, I'd have gotten a 7.11% return from that investment.

So yes, go seek the greatest companies. 

I happen to think that yes, FAGM will be dominant for years to come, but also believe there's a high likelihood that their stock price growth will slow as the law of big numbers take effect. And just as every other large company dominated and then fell by the wayside, we are all posed with asking ""what will the next outperformer be?""

And me, you and every other person out there might have different ideas."
7,2020-09-23,g6as78e,sonofabitchXmustXpay,StockMarket,Always wondered why they've never seriously gotten into the online business. Fear of knowing they cannot compete with Amazon ?
8,2020-09-23,g6b67u4,ThemChecks,StockMarket,"I own some but I'm not too sure why...

It is stable enough and they can probably adapt. Strangely I am more confident in Altria to maintain high yield even if share price deteriorates due to the cash flow produced by cigarettes and the like. But reits are a better dividend stock in general... STAG is offering over 4% and has Amazon warehouses, so there ya go."
9,2020-09-23,g6co450,StarWolf478,StockMarket,"While Amazon does enter many fields, they do so in a very focused way that aligns with their mission, has corporate synergy, and they usually don't easily abandon their projects after they commit to them because they do have a clear focus for the fundamental directions that they are going in.

The ""Prime Bike"" that you mention definitely aligns with Amazon's mission to ""continually raise the bar of the customer experience through the Internet and technology"" and I can very easily see how a product like that has corporate synergy and could be used to raise the customer's Amazon Prime experience and sell more Amazon Prime subscriptions that will generate more revenue for Amazon. As Steve Jobs talked about in the video that I posted, this is an example of something that does make macrocosmic sense for Amazon's mission and the direction that they are going in and will create a total that is greater than the sum of the parts. And I'm also confident based on their track record that Amazon likely won't abandon the project after they commit to it.

The difference between that and Google is that Google often jumps into things that don't align with their mission to ""organize the world's information"" and don't have corporate synergy or a plan for how they will generate money from it. While Amazon enters new fields very deliberately and with a clear mission in mind; Google's culture is one that just throws darts at random things that they find interesting right now without taking the time to aim and focus on the bullseye. And then they often eventually get bored with their projects and abandon them before they have had time to fully mature so that they can shift their attention onto some new shiny objects that they find interesting for a while until they lose interest in those objects as well.

That is why Google; despite having very talented engineers, a strong brand, and plenty of cash; hasn't had any great new successes in the last decade in my opinion whereas a company like Amazon has had many great new successes that have created new value for their entire business and pushed their mission forward."
10,2020-09-23,g6bj3ue,1foxyboi,StockMarket,"It's not an opinion if amazon literally operates and competes in more fields than google. It would be factually true to say they are less focused by basic logic.

Nice try chump"

12,2020-09-23,g6apjit,StarWolf478,StockMarket,"I'm actually looking to sell my Google stock fairly soon. I've become more bearish on the company lately and have started to believe that it will under-perform the other Big Tech companies (Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, and Facebook) over the next few years, so I'm sticking with those four and dumping Google.

What caused me to start turning bearish on Google was first watching [this old video from Steve Jobs](https://youtu.be/H8eP99neOVs?t=39) and that got me thinking that what Steve Jobs was talking about in that video is the same problem that Google has been facing for many years now. They have a focus problem. Google is going off in many different directions doing arguably interesting things, but their lack of focus has been keeping them from creating any truly great new profitable products that have great corporate synergy to help them grow their entire business.

Then reading through [https://killedbygoogle.com/](https://killedbygoogle.com/) confirmed that for me even more.

I also believe that Google has the weakest management of the Big Tech companies. The other Big Tech companies have leaders with clear visions for what they want their companies to be and the motivation to never give up on achieving the vision for their companies no matter what. I don't see that with Google's management.

So, my prediction over the next few years is that Facebook will have better ad revenue growth than Google, Google will be less profitable than Apple in the mobile market and digital store market, Google will continue to be a distant third place to Amazon and Microsoft in the cloud market, Tesla will be more successful than Google in the self-driving vehicles market, and there will be many more failed projects added to the [https://killedbygoogle.com/](https://killedbygoogle.com/) website."

The amazing part isn’t that it’s one innovation it’s five incremental innovations that compound. It means non verticalized companies will have extreme difficulty replicating.

Tbh this alone was amazing - but autonomy is the other big bet. Tesla can go full tilt passing savings on to customers (a la amazon) because they have a massive software upsell (fsd).

0,2020-09-24,g6fjqa1,WildBill19,StockMarket,"Excellent question! Yes, SHMP has absolutely been the target of market manipulation in the past. Obviously, I can't say that won't happen again but as someone holding long, that doesn't necessarily bother me -- I've actually sold about 1/3 of my holdings a couple of times now during what I believed to be minor pumps and bought them back weeks later with house money. I'm much less open to doing that now than I was a year ago and have actually increased my position, as I truly believe we will see a REAL rise in price sooner than later, as more institutional investors will be gaining access (I have no insider knowledge but do believe there is a high likelihood that a major investor will be announced once they've uplisted). 

Additionally, what's different now vs. previous years is they're being extremely transparent with their technology and the company roadmap (there is even an upcoming open Q&A session with shareholders and company leadership). That's because they're actually moving into a revenue-producing phase with substantial evidence it will actually happen. They did not want the publicity before they were ready only to risk having an Amazon/Whole Foods, Costco, Kirkland, Walmart, etc. come in and throw a ton of money at an attempted replication of their technology after they've spent 20 hard years of R&D to get to this point. 

I've seen more formal company updates and press releases in the last 6 months than the previous 3 years combined (scroll to the bottom to see the news/press releases - [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SHMP/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SHMP/)). That alone indicated something was going on and when I read the news that the three institutional investors jumped on in June, it seemed like a no-brainer. Now, with the uplisting to the Nasdaq, H.C. Wainwright Investor Conference, and the CFO explicitly stating they would be ""very profitable"" in 2021 if there were any time to believe in SHMP it would be now. I don't see all these positive updates in this short of a time period as a coincidence. 

Looking at this logically, they would be playing quite the long game if this were a true scam and I doubt they would risk uplisting to the Nasdaq, only to get denied and ruin their scam (most investors/shareholders won't give them a 2nd chance on this). Additionally, the SEC requires OTCQB (this is what SHMP is) stocks (vs. OTCQX) to have independent auditors who are registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) and mandates a company to have a board of directors that includes at least two Independent Directors and an Audit Committee, a majority of the members of which are Independent Directors (believe this is dependent on how you report your financials). 

As great as it sounded early on, I was very skeptical for quite a while and had similar thoughts of getting burned (again, this is the only OTC asset I own and not typically my cup of tea). However, they have proven out their technology with various independent companies across the world that are leaders in the aquaculture space and would not risk muddying their name by partnering and making positive press releases with a company like SHMP if it weren't legit -- what's the point?! If you or anyone else notices something I've missed that points to a scam, please share it and I'll look into it immediately with a legitimate update.

Lastly, look at the videos from the Texas Restaurant Association Tradeshow... those shrimp are absolutely huge and look delicious. Could they've bought them and flown them in? Sure, but I truly believe they would've dropped the ball by now if it was a bunch of BS. Skip to 4 minutes in to see some great shots of the shrimp - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tXXyJv7TAc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tXXyJv7TAc)

The likelihood of them being accepted on the Nasdaq? They've hired the appropriate consultants and external resources to make this happen the right way. I have full confidence they would not have applied if they weren't certain they would get approval, nor would they have spoken at the H.C. Wainwright Investor Conference -- check out the 20-minute recording (https://wsw.com/webcast/hcw7/shmp/1618264) and you will see their CFO is very bold but calculated with his forward-looking statements. I've yet to catch him or SHMP misleading shareholders with anything they've told us (again, please direct me to anything that says otherwise).

7,2020-09-27,g6qyqyy,HeavyG_93,StockMarket,"Maybe. I mean everyone thought Amazon was overpriced the whole way up too man. 

The new game in town is scaling and vertical integration. Because doing these things requires huge capital investment it makes the P/E ratios out of whack. 

Tesla has such a fat lead on battery quality, production scale, and building cost that they’re going to have a huuuuge percent of the EV market share moving forward because they’ll have a superior product at a comparable price.

Not to mention their expansion into autonomous ride hailing, utility scale energy storage distribution, auto insurance, etc. 


Tesla has many revenue streams in its future. They’ll be the only vertically integrated automobile company so the cost at which they’re able to churn out these Tesla model 3s and their subcompact care when they make it will be incredibly hard for American manufacturers (Ford and GM especially) to compete because while GM and Ford are car companies, Tesla will be Transportation company. And with multiple revenue streams they’ll just be able to price GM and Ford out of the market.

8,2020-09-25,g6jhqrm,burnshimself,finance,"For my money, they'll never beat Steam for a variety of reasons.

1. Gaming customers are highly suspicious of subscription / streaming. This is an industry that freaked out on Sony when PS4 was going to have digital-only games rather than physical games. The customer base has not been trained to like subscription-based pricing. They know it is designed to suck more money out of them and fuck them by raising the subscription price down the line + disintermediating them as owners of their games. There are plenty of alternatives to subscription-based games (both Console and PC for-purchase games) which consumers are more likely to choose
2. Steam is gamer-focused and privately owned / operated by a beloved founder (Gabe Newell). The gaming industry has a deep subculture (largely internet-based), strong brand loyalty and a suspicion of large, profit-oriented corporations (see: hatred for EA, Blizzard). I highly doubt many gamers will pick Amazon (giant multi-industry multi-national corporation bent on taking over all industries with a reputation for screwing over low-wage workers and an egoist founder) over Steam from a cultural perspective, and in fact I expect most gamers will be highly suspicious of Amazon
3. Steam has a huge head start. They've been at this with Steam for 15 years. That comes with a lot of operational knowhow that Amazon will be catching up with
4. Steam has an engrained customer base of 95 million monthly active users. It's going to be tough for Amazon to steal away those users, and if they intend to it will be a tough battle
5. Steam has tens of thousands of titles on their platform, including many of the hottest titles, and the established relationships to keep onboarding additional new titles. I doubt that the industry's big developers (EA, Blizzard, TakeTwo, etc.) will want to partner with an Amazon streaming service when they know they'll be essentially priming themselves to get fucked by Amazon in a few years. Nor will the key console developers (Microsoft, Sony, Nintendo) want to partner with Amazon for that reason + the competitive dynamic with their consoles. And that is what consumers want out of gaming - the key premiere titles. Nobody wants to stream a bunch of garbage games.
6. Steam is highly cost competitive - they run huge sales at fairly regular intervals. I don't see a big cost arbitrage opportunity for Amazon to come in and undercut Steam in this regard
7. Steam is highly engrained in the indie gaming community. They have thousands of indie gaming titles and are seen as a huge source of support for that industry. I doubt that indie game developers will switch over to Amazon's streaming platform without being paid a king's ransom because Steam has been so integral to that."

You may be surprised to find out how picky mainstream gamers are with their experience.

Casual mobile gamers are where streaming could be a hit in the future when internet data caps and throttling don't get in the way as much.

Where game streaming can find a nice niche in the meantime though is as an added bonus to other services and not as it's own standalone service.

i.e. Most Xbox gamers already have or will be using Xbox Game Pass, so the streaming will be a nice edge up on someone like Sony or Nintendo.

Amazon could add some additional perks for Twitch viewers (another extra free sub or whatever to a channel and other things that go above and beyond what is already provided).

They could also start funding games that utilize streaming in a way that can't really be done otherwise. Think like advanced ""Twitch plays"" kind of stuff.

However, it's also going to directly clash with other innovations in gaming such VR/AR, higher resolutions, and other features that will significantly increase data usage if done solely through streaming. So best case scenario for quite some time is that streaming is treated as an option ""in addition to"" and not as a standalone service."

32,2020-09-25,g6jfutc,street-guru,investing,"**Morgan Stanley thinks $ATVI, $TTWO, and $EA better cloud gaming plays**

Morgan Stanley:

""AMZN has the cloud and community for Luna to succeed, but they will likely need AAA (potentially exclusive) content to compete and scale adoption. We still see publishers (ATVI, TTWO, EA) as best way to play the cloud gaming transition.""

""Today at its Fall 2020 event, AMZN announced that customers in the U.S. can request early access to its new cloud gaming service, Amazon Luna. Accompanying Luna AMZN announced an Alexa-enabled controller at an introductory price of $49.99 during the early access period. Players can subscribe to the Luna+ game channel at an introductory price of $5.99/month during the early access period with access to games including Resident Evil 7, Control and others. AMZN also announced a new gaming channel with UBI available through Luna that will give subscribers access to new titles like Assassin's Creed Valhalla, Far Cry 6 and Immortals Fenyx Rising the same day they release. The service will be available on Fire TV, PC, and Mac as well as on web apps for iPhone and iPad, with Android coming soon.""

""Luna Makes Three, as Cloud Gaming Competition Heats Up... With this announcement, the three largest public cloud companies (AMZN, MSFT, and GOOGL) are now all officially in the race. As detailed in Subscription Services and Cloud Gaming...What's At Stake and Who Wins?, we believe that any cloud gaming platform will need to combine the best content, community, and cloud technology in order to succeed (see Exhibit 1). To that point, MSFT recently acquired Bethesda Softworks to help correct its first-party content deficit (more on that here), while GOOGL Stadia’s slow start is at least (in our view) partially attributable to its limited content offering.""

""...But A to Z Still Missing 1 of 3 C's...We see AMZN as well positioned to enter the fray, given the strength of its AWS and Twitch assets, which should provide the necessary tech and community. That said, offering all of the leading content is a non-negotiable part of any gaming platform. So while AMZN’s early publisher partnerships are good first steps, in our view, Luna will need to expand its content offering significantly in order to become a viable platform and (eventually) an alternative to conventional gaming hardware. Additionally, while MSFT xCloud has the advantage of slowly building a following by offering cloud gaming as a perk for Xbox users, AMZN (and GOOGL) face a steeper hurdle to convince gamers to switch over entirely.""

""...and Game Publishers (ATVI, EA, TTWO) Are Positioned to Benefit: While distribution is a green field opportunity for AMZN, in our view, the clearest beneficiaries of the transition to cloud gaming are publishers like ATVI/EA/TTWO/UBI, which own the leading content. As a base case, this new technology has the opportunity to shift consumer spend from zero gross margin hardware sales to games/digital goods, as well as to expand the addressable player base by lowering barriers to entry around gaming…which could in turn boost monetization and even create brand new opportunities like advertising (see Could Console Advertising Be the Next Multi-Billion Dollar Ad Market?). More competition in the game distribution business will likely be positive for the publishers as well, as it could increase negotiating leverage with their distribution partners and create an opportunity to lower the platform fees they pay today on console gaming (similar to what we already saw in PC gaming). Finally, we note that the strategic value of the leading game publishers continues only to rise as cloud gaming competition heats up. MSFT’s recent Bethesda acquisition likely only accentuates this trend."""

Investing in Amazon is not the same as investing purely in AWS. It's all or nothing, you get retail, prime video, advertising, marketplace. In my opinion, as long as Bezos is CEO (sell when he retires), the company will do well.

The real question you should be asking is what is the value of Amazon? Everyone knows it's a great company to invest in, you'll be hard pressed to find a bear on the company. Is the current price fair?"
37,2020-09-25,g6jmj5g,spike_owens,investing,"Amazon has a huge first mover advantage, and they likely still have more in house cloud products than the others, so you could theoretically probably use only Amazon products for all of your data needs if you wanted to, and users seem to become somewhat locked in with Amazon products once they start using them. I think that will keep customers from leaving for Azure or GCP in the short to intermediate term, but they don't really have a moat for new customers. The offering from the big 3 are very similar, although I've heard that Google doesn't have the level of customer support that AWS and Microsoft have.

As others have said, Snowflake isn't a competitor to AWS, it's a competitor to one AWS product. Similar to the Apple App Store offering Apple Music, but also letting you use a competing service from Spotify from the same store.  Amazon would rather you use Redshift, but will also let you use Snowflake on AWS.

The big threat from companies like Snowflake would be in ease of switching to a different cloud provider. If you're using snowflake as the DB, and Tableau as your visualization tool, and Neo4J for graph data, etc. then you're not really locked into AWS, since those tools are available on Azure and GCP as well.

I think the biggest unknown is how margins will hold up going forward. Pricing for cloud services is like a black box for some things right now. It's like early days of cell service, where you didn't know the cost of a phone call since prices were based on time of day, local/long distance, cell provider of each person on the call, etc. Eventually so much capacity was built out that cell providers started offering more straightforward and cheaper plans.

I think that is going to happen with cloud services. Right now you are basically guessing how much some processes will cost, and learning on the fly how to properly limit how much you're spending on cloud computing. If you follow machine learning on twitter/linkedin, you'll see how even really experienced researchers get caught off-guard when running processes on cloud GPUs and end up with a $10k+ bill for not properly ending a process that used a GPU cluster that ran in the background for a week. I think within the next couple of years you'll get away from hourly/instance pricing and get standard bundles, like 10tb of storage, 64gb of memory, and 1,000 hours of gpu/cpu time for $1,000 a month, or whatever configuration meets the needs of like 90% of users, of course, they'll still make money by charging a set amount per seat for employees, but even that could get competed down."

I think it would be important to get some perspectives outside of reddit.  political and social unrest/instability is certainly a feature of the current landscape, but why is the presumption that this necessarily impacts the future cashflow generation ability of public companies?  I think you're asking that someone lay out an argument to disprove a thing you have assumed must be true, but realistically you should be evidencing this to start.  Because I see no reason to assume any of those factors will impact the intermediate term valuation of the majority of public companies.

Sometimes people abstract too far away from what ""the market"" is, and that clouds their understanding of what impacts it.  Does 10% unemployment and a collection of angry boomers yelling at each other in Washington necessarily mean Amazon will have lower sales?  Do protests in the streets impact how many graphics cards Nvidia moves?  Does MCD really see a reduction in cashflow due to an election?  If someone were to float that idea the onus would be on them to prove it, yes?  So why does it need to be inherently disproven that these things impact ""the market""?  It's so strange to me that this is the top comment in what should be an investment driven community; the underlying presumption here is that these conditions impacting markets is a given and must be disproven, where as anyone that has a solid grasp of finance would know this is mostly noise.

I think many of the new posters here think ""politics, protests, local businesses closing, etc are all things central to my life and therefore these must be things impacting public companies"".  This is not a good place to start an investment thesis from."

Ironically, Amazon, Netflix, and Tesla all fall under this category. But do you honestly believe these fast growing companies are 'zombies'? Furthermore, share buybacks have reduced book values of many companies with excellent earning powers below zero. Among them are Home Depot and Philip Morris International. Finally, tech companies derive most their earning power from intangible assets and not from traditional definition of the book value."

Get into the habit of using delta to select strikes, not %. A 10% OTM strike for T is a very different delta than 10% OTM of AMZN (7 and 20 delta, respectively, for October monthly calls when I checked just now).

> the only way that I lose money is if the stock trades for lower than the strike price

That is only true if you hold until expiration. But here is everything going on until that point:

* A lot of capital is tied up for a long time with no guarantee of profit. LEAPS are expensive.

* You get no benefit of share ownership: no dividends, no voting.

* You could be running a loss for most of the holding period. 10% OTM on 2023 AAPL call LEAPS is about $11 OTM for about double that in premium, so say $33 for break-even. AAPL could easily stay under that break-even for the better part of the next 2 years. This means that if you need to exit the trade early, for whatever reason, there's a good chance you'll net a loss.

* Liquidity is low. Even if you want to exit early, you may pay and arm and a leg to do so.

* Theta decay. While it will be low for most of your holding period, the last 60 days will make up for lost time. It's even possible for inflation to outpace theta decay during the first 12 months.

True, if AAPL runs above your strike early, you might be able to bail out for a profit despite all of the above."

Bet at least double the contract value and I’ll go Monday and buy one in 0.01 increments. You can literally look at the trade history of the options and see it lol. It’s not exactly hard to check... better yet just go to the RH 10/2 NKLA table. Select the 28.5Calls try to buy one for 0.09 cents and itll say you cant. Then look at the contract details and you literally see that it traded for 0.09 today...

——-

Yes if he tried to close each option individually it would be 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, etc (on RH or SCHW; supposedly TOS but tbh I don’t believe that).... 

if RH ever updates spreads rules in the future then it may be the same way. As of literally today, the $0.05 increment thing does not apply to spreads on RH. If he had TW or IBKR I know for a fact they don’t have that 0.05 rule on NKLA specifically (again some super low  volume penny stocks may have it; and obviously futures/cash indexes do, as well as super expensive amazon options that are like $10,000, but that’s only when it’s expensive if you sold if for $10,000 and it went to zero you could close it out for a 0.01). 



The $5k is coming from the spread being $1 wide which is $100 in acct/notional value. There’s 50x spreads so 50x$100=$5000. Most real brokers will start by requiring $5k of free acct cash to place this trade then they will consider your credit received so if he received 0.20 per spread then that’s $1000 total credit so a real broker will hold up $4k of your money. RH doesn’t do it that way and they will hold up all $5k worth."

That's why cloud stocks look overvalued - people want to get in early if there's a long runway of growth.

So many of these companies have rallied so hard that any correction would still leave you in the green if you invested early. 

AMZN was $300 in 2015.

ADBE was just $71.

ADBE was just 5-yr fwd PE of 8 in hindsight.

AMZN was just 5yr fwd PE of 9 in hindsight.

I remember in 2015 people were saying AMZN is a great company but they're losing money, WAY overvalued.

ADBE was 131 PE.

8,2020-09-26,g6qew4v,Dry-Jump-7483,investing,"ETFs don't usually follow the same rate of return as a sector its tracking. I think the two major reasons are:

1. The larger players in most markets are not active solely across that market. In cloud computing, each of the largest players (Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Alibaba, IBM, etc) is involved in many other markets (adjacent and otherwise) than just cloud computers. As these players tend to take up the lions share of the ETF, they tend to mean that the value of the ETF is affected by the constituents' performance in many other markets.
2. ETFs only include listed companies... in many markets, a significant proportion of activity involves players that aren't listed. The variance between the ETF and the market's performance is likely to correlate inversely to the proportion of the market that is listed (more listed, less variance).

Simply put, most market/sector ETFs don't bear much resemblance in their performance to the market/sector which they are tracking. They may bring the promise of diversification, but frankly you would be better off diversifying into a different market/sector to achieve that effect. 

My recommendation: buy and hold the top one or two players in your market/sector (i.e. Amazon and Microsoft in cloud computing) where possible, and ignore the rest. If the top players aren't listed... tough luck! Don't dilute the competitive strength of your portfolio by allocating to subpar players in the market."

We also have elected politicians whose job we have decided is to figure out what to do about a Bezos in our society - his level of wealth is unprecedented, and it is in part on the backs of the proletariat engineers, developers, coders, delivery drivers, etc. Just because we've decided as a society that we appreciate a Prime delivery service doesn't mean we also don't think he should have a cap on his wealth, he should pay taxes, he should pay employees a good wage. If he can't make those decisions himself, then he needs some help from the other leadership of the country. Anyway, highly recommend checking out the Pitchfork Economics podcast! <3"

His money is effectively just a  tool of power.  The decisions he makes aren't to feed himself, or live a life of even more luxury, but to manage the world around him.

We give him the democratic right to manage the world around him by buying his goods. We can always choose to buy another person's goods if we no longer think that his decisions result in the best use of our money.  In this way, we continually elect Bezos every single day.  

The politicians hate Bezos, because he rules over a much more democratic kingdom than them.  They are jealous of his power, and wish that they could have it for themselves.  But they can't, unless the commies take over.  That is what makes America so great.  We actually have true checks and balances, and a truer democracy."

It is a good time to invest the market corrected last month and there still a few deals to be had. I have invested lost everything once when i was your age in 1999 it was all great in November but by January my entire portfolio when down almost 70 percent thankfully i had some Lockeed Martin and Marvel Comic stock that brought me back up. But stuff like Lucent and Nokia were practically worthless and never recovered. I only picked marvel because i liked comics and LMT because my dad worked there. Pick stuff you like since it is easier to follow and know when they making terrible moves. 

I'd suggest using the Warren Buffet method of picking two stocks that really believe in and don't mind holding long term and an etf in a sector you like. Apple and Microsoft are both way down from their all time highs and have decent dividends. They also have a lot of support around 104 and 200 dollars. These two would minimize your risk since they are very well run companies and have shown a history of innovation. The growth of amazon is tempting but you will only end up with 2 or 3 shares but there is plenty of upside.

The problem with Apple is they claim to own all the real estate in town and all the stores. Apps are basically the brands in the store; they are the reason the customers go to a particular store (i.e. grocery versus electronics).

Normally, you can shop around. I can go buy that game, Bluray, etc. at Best Buy, a Gamestop, Wal-Mart, online at like Amazon, or at locally owned entertainment/electronics store, or an online speciality store.

You can't shop around for an app in Apple town, because they own the real estate and every retail store in town is an Apple Store.

If I buy a house, I don't have to worry about the contractor dictating what I do with it for all time; how I remodel it, decorate it, of I make minor repairs myself or through a third party, etc. If I want to tear it all out and just leave the frame to rebuild off of, I can do it.

When you buy an Apple product, you have to worry about whether they allow you to remodel it, make repairs, etc.

If we applied the same logic some are applying to Apple here elsewhere... There would be no private property.

They own all the real estate in the city, they own the government of the city, and every store is the exact same Apple store.

If Tesla can truly pull off its battery production numbers, and if it continues to innovate on its technology, it could definitely be as valuable as Amazon/worth at least a trillion by the 2030 3 terrawatt production date. 

Climate change and old grids make Tesla’s battery storage a much more attractive and cheap option to boost grid reliability and provide a buffer for peak heat days like in California. Plus with Battery Day announcing using iron for low cost storage, I expect Tesla to see a surge in demand as their storage gets cheaper.

As far as their vehicles, they are lightyears ahead of Big Automotive. Toyota said they could give a shit less about full electric for now, GM is actually fucking stupid with Nikola, and Ford is in debt up to their eyeballs. But Tesla is still ironing out quality kinks, and the longevity of their current lineup has yet to be really measured by consumers. At the end of the day, if you are shopping for the best electric car/SUV, you almost always end up at Tesla or caving for some shitty 150 mile range economy box. 

So in summation, Tesla could definitely be worth a trillion by 2030, and maybe even sooner depending on if they can deliver on hype and technological advances."

I don't think they're inherently evil, but because of the nature of Private Equity, they can pretty much invest in or do anything they want, so they come up with ways to make money without always thinking what it may lead to down the road. For the housing crisis, you had Banks rolling Mortgages into tranches and MBSs and CDOs, which in theory was fine until people starting getting complacent in their due diligence. In the case of Private Equity, you see that happening, for example in this article where Private Equity is leading to increases in the cost of Healthcare.

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-05-20/private-equity-is-ruining-health-care-covid-is-making-it-worse?sref=l4nbvXQ0](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-05-20/private-equity-is-ruining-health-care-covid-is-making-it-worse?sref=l4nbvXQ0)

So all the wealth that Mark Zuckerberg or Jeff Bezos has, it really pales in comparison to the wealth that Private Equity has/controls. According to this article is a $10 Trillion Industry.

1,2020-10-02,g7ddls6,hautran,finance,"haha, I can see that. I think yes, the ones you describe are self made, but they aren't the ""Oligarchy"" in the sense that he's talking about. Those (to me) are ""Captains of Industry"" like Mike Bloomberg. They're self made and they understand giving back to society and pledging to not give so much to their children.(I know Gates/Bloomberg/Zuckerberg, I don't think Bezos has) Then you have your Trump/ Betsy Devos/ Erik Prince/ Koch Brothers (I'm not saying anything towards whether they're evil or not because frankly I don't trust what I read in the news anymore.) And I think that's one of the points that he makes, is the people who are inheriting this wealth, you wouldn't even know them. Abigail Johnson for example, you probably don't hear that name often. But she's worth $15 billion and runs Fidelity Investments, a company started by her grandfather. Everyone points to Jeff Bezos or Mark Zuckerberg, but I don't think most people even realize who's actually pulling the strings. Frankly I don't think it takes that much to buy Politicians off, and the truely talented don't need to buy Politicians off to make money.

Edit: Oh sorry, and as for global power index, I don't disagree with you, but that can only be maintained so long. I think you see it coming to fruition now, where the US is struggling and China is poised to overtake us as the #1 world power. Neither side is perfect, Mike Bloomberg's view (which I agree with) is that the fundamentals of our economy has changed so we need to change with it, by educating our workforce for the jobs of tomorrow (improve public education), welcome the entrepreneurs of tomorrow (immigration reform), retrain those whose jobs are becoming obsolete, invest in science and innovation so we maintain our technological and competitive edge. The list goes on. But Politicians don't do that, they'd rather drum up controversy over race and inequality to get elected."

To me it seems like most of the wealthiest (Gates, Zuckerberg, Bezos) are self-made themselves. I would also counter, not by saying it’s better or not worse, by saying the “economic penalty” of what you’re describing seems to be that while Western Europe may have a more equal economy, they have a much lower global power index by Virtue of lower capability to compete globally.

Progress is ignored in favor of political points. Not saying civil war or breakup of the country, but perhaps an accelerated decline. More and more time spent at home (who has been a primary beneficiary during this? any home-related retailer - RH, etc; people have invested in their houses, buying new houses, etc; they've made the investments and now they're going to use/enjoy them.)

Only problem is you have to use CurrencyFair to load your account. I find it weird why tastyworks has a Sydney office yet you can’t just load funds into an Australian account to them directly. 

Time difference like others said is a killer. I’m a morning person so up at 5am usually to make a few adjustments before the close at 6am. That timing will improve now after daylight savings. Initially I was using bracket (OCO orders) to stop loss myself out of bad news but I’m trying without it now.

I know anything can happen during a day and most action happens at the open but I’m mostly trading ETFs so the daily moves aren’t as large. Hard to trade Amazon, Tesla etc in the way I trade so I avoid them. Also hard to do earnings trades unless you’re up all night I feel. 

Tax treatment for all my trades was really difficult to work out. For someone trading as an individual (not sole trader) the ATO has very little guidance on how to treat your gains.

I have managed funds which are doing well and multiple others. This isn’t my first run at the market. I have other assets like a rare BMW and some precious metals. I’m young and I definitely appreciate your concern but I’m taking my high risk moves I know I can pay off at this age. I’ve done my research on the companies before I threw money at them and the bottom line is you can’t predict the market but I went off a gut feeling after how I’ve seen other companies preform in the same market. And we don’t have a financial advisor or just take our money. He’s done very well for us in the past 13 years by bringing in over 7 figures and he also recommended that I take the risk.

Are you a day trader?

Are you a swing trader?

Do you hold forever?

Are you an investor?

Do you short the market?

The most profitable method is to do all of the above.

It's flawed when people are arguing one side. Truth is, you should do both. Be an investor. But also have another account where you trade.

Example

Set up 2 accounts

In the first account, you buy companies you believe in -- and companies you know are solid for the long haul. Doesn't matter what I think or whether they are the same as mine. Point is -- it's something that **you** believe in. Something that follows Warren Buffet's 10 year rule. Only for this account. So for me, I buy Google, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Visa, Disney. These companies aren't going anywhere. Whatever stock that **you** believe in for the *long haul*. You buy it. And you let that sit there. If it gives you dividends, even better. Great. That account. Don't touch it. That's your forever stock account. Don't touch this account.

Ok now let's open up a 2nd account.

This 2nd account is where you aren't married to any stock. It's your fling account. So you hear some news about such and such stock. Buy it. Sell at 20% profit. You hear about a new company going IPO. Asana. Or maybe Palantir. Worth a buy. Shit. You lost money. Oh well. It happens. But the point is, this account, you are buying and selling and you aren't married to anything. You hear about another stock. Buy it. Sell at 20% profit. If the market is shitty, sell every 5%. If the market is great, sell every 20%. So you hear that XYZ company is coming out a new product. Great. Worth a shot. Buy it. Turned out great? Good. Take profit. No good? Losing money? Get out. You're not married to any stock in the 2nd account. Are you bullish on the market? Buy SPY. Are you bearish on the market? Load up on SDS. etc.

If you do this, what are you?

You're everything. You are investing and trading, both at the same time. And it is imo a great strategy because you reap all the benefits of both paths. You get dividends. You get compound interest. You get all that from your 1st account. But you get your kicks from your 2nd account."

Yes options have more leverage and control more shares of an underlying but tech didn’t rally that hard from the March lows because of a group of gamblers. Tech moved because of the new covid economy and what both retail and institutional investors saw as the smart play, as well as having huge amounts of growth being pulled forward which dragged the overall market up with it from the bottom. Virtual meetings, gaming, Netflix, YouTube, Facebook, Amazon/online shopping, it all saw massive demand and record profits. So I’d still argue that’s what moved the market more then retail did....the covid tech boom that dragged us up."

The question reminds me of this classic book:

[Where are the Customer's Yachts? or A Good Hard look at Wall Street](https://www.amazon.com/Where-Are-Customers-Yachts-Street/dp/0471770892)

Professional investment services (esp. advocates of active mgmt and the hedge fund industry) never seem to fail to recognize with eagle eyes, the calamitous danger of investors moving to lower cost innovations, while being much less sensitive to decades of inefficiencies and systematic fleecing of customers. I don't use Robinhood, but I appreciate that the platform helped kick off a new competitive wave of for brokerages in the US, and consider their presence a net positive for all retail investors.

That said, there is some basic mistakes which many young/small investors make, and learn from through experience(or avoid through exceptional competence). Concentrated + undiversified positions of a handful of well known stocks, which amplifies their risk exposure, but that has nothing to do with the use of any platform. Diversification has long been a strong remedy to underperformance of particular sectors and markets.

Emotions get hold of some folks at the wrong time leading to panic selling, especially for the young and inexperienced, but again, that sort of thing is not the fault of any platform, but a human vulnerability which can be tempered with learning and experience.

As to the dangers of amateur investors - the market will do just fine, thank you very much."

Why doesn’t everyone just copy you?” Warren Buffett responded Jeff by saying, **“Because nobody wants to get rich slow.”**

If someone has a sustainable approach to doing reasonably well over time, that's great. A plan that includes the line, ""The disadvantage though is that if the price goes below the strike, I am basically FUCKED."" doesn't sound sustainable.

While this is right to a small extent, I think the wider breakeven and lower slippage (and commission which you shouldn't care about for now) are what makes the wider spread P/L materialize quicker.

I also forgot to mention manageability, it's a lot easier to manage (by rolling out for a credit mainly) a single wide spread rather than a few tight ones. The reason being is once the stock price crosses somewhere in the middle of your strikes your spread's theta turns negative. Which means you can't roll for a credit anymore. With a tight spread since your long leg is very close to your short leg, and when you factor in slippage, it becomes almost non-practical to roll for a credit if your spreads are challenged at all. Another way to look at this, is it's theoretically always possible to roll a naked option for a credit. Wide spreads behave the closest to a naked option, then it would be easier to roll them out for a credit.

I am also comfortable risking a minimal amount of captial on more speculative plays, like those surrounding disruptive innovation. This means any technology that has the potential but not the guarantee to shake up current industry. Especially if that technology is not yet polished or proven, because refinement can come in time and it likely will as long as the medium provides for greater access, better utilization, and/or further propagation of ideas. 

Take the internet as whole. It was initially discounted, it lacked polish or proof of validity over the long term and yet today it is indispensable to nearly everyone. Take the evolution of the blog, which at first was ridiculed and said to be unreliable and immature, but now provides a medium rich in information and validity. 

These things take time. I am happy to allocate a small percentage of my equity to these ideas. All I need is one of 30 to hit big and my assumed risk will be rewarded. 

I would never advocate for putting an individuals entire networth into these types of funds, but I think it is irresponsible to discount the possibility of success based on a fear of failure or outmoded models of allocation that in all reasonable assessment have been behind the curve of innovation. 

I can see clear upside in technologies surround genomics and financial technology, for instance. Let's take traditional banking as an example. This system regularly cuts out access to large portions of the global population based in numerous factors, such as physical or geographical lack of access, or because they are deemed too risky to take on, or because of structural bias against subsets of the population. 

If a disruptive technology comes along like SQ that offers greater access and mobility of capital accross populations and classes, it makes sense that they will attract and retain users on a more rapid scale than traditional firms. That creates a sustained competitive advantage, and if the firm is able to build consumer loyalty it will be difficult to wrench the consumer away unless another firm can provide adequate economic incentives for the customer to switch. 

Sustaining this advantage can be done by creating a sticky business model, like IMB did in the past (we know how that turned out) or Oracle does currently (this has yet to play out, but I would argue without a fundamental shift in philosophy Oracle will continue to lose marketshare to their more innovative competitors), or by building an innovation stack that can rapid respond to a dynamic marketplace and continually create value for the consumer (Amazon, for instance). 

Rarely do entrenched businesses have a culture or leadership team that can rapidly respond to these disruptions in a way that can effectively recapture lost market share. I am absolutely willing to take a small bet on the increased prevalence of Zillow or Open Door, for instance, because I can see that the current firms surrounding housing sales have not adapted to shifting market demands very effectively. They are entrenched, archaic, and tedious to deal with; in contrast, Zillow provides a much smoother and friendly experience in searching for and procuring a new home. So much so that these more traditional firms have largely begun to utilize the platform to serve their own ends. This makes it easier for Zillow to leverage the competition to their advantage and further disrupt the traditional business model. 

Of course, there are local, state, and federal regulatory hurdles to be managed, but over time the efficiency of captial markets will favor the most innovative and accessible firms over the more entrenched and laggard ones. 

In summary, taking on a small amount of risk in emerging technologies often leads to greater returns on capital than the conservative and traditional methodology of 60, 40 ""safe"" equity and bonds. That isn't to say an individual should fully embrace that risk, but it is prudent invest in all potential outcomes with varying allocation based on individual preferences for risk.

8,2020-10-04,g7ojwra,Beastrick,investing,This pretty much already states that you are talking bs here. Based on your statement that S&P has returned just 20% since you started investing means that you started investing in 2018 or later for that statement to be true. You also stated in other comment that you are buying long term so no market timing etc so I assume you just buy and hold. Now that out of the way tell me a company that has gone up 1200% in last 2 years excluding one time events like SPI going up 3000% a day since that is pretty much market timing. Hint: no FAANG stocks come even close in fact if you bought Apple in 2010 or Amazon in 2013 you still would not get this kind of return. Even if you bough Tesla at it's lowest point in 2019 you would still get only 900% return if your timing was perfect (bought at lowest point and still holding) and that is pretty much the best stock in disruptive innovation category so even if you were all-in you still would not get this kind of return. So you are just making things up here.

But it's ignorant to look at the world around us and act as if oil is going to make this comeback back to its 2000s highs. The energy information administration says that [**68% of our oil consumption is due to transportation**](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/oil-and-petroleum-products/use-of-oil.php)

Further broken down, of our transportation consumption of oil, gasoline is the biggest consumer, followed by distillate oil (diesel), followed by HGL, followed by Jet fuel

Gasoline and distillate oil for cars are going to soon become afterthoughts. We already have companies producing cars that are fully electric, and now with companies like Hyliion focused on making large automobiles that are fully electric, we might see the diesel usage plummet. Apps like Zoom and Skype are going to crush the airline industry, and business meetings that once required plane travel will be done from the comfort of our homes. 


the same source says the **industrial sector consumes 26% of all oil in the United States**. This is also going to plummet. Large conglomerates like Amazon and Walmart have pledged to be carbon neutral and use 100% renewable energy within a matter of decades. Large companies are going to be pressured to follow their lead, and this is especially the case if Biden wins (the guy who plans to pledge 1.4+ trillion dollars to the renewable energy sector)


And then you have miscellaneous oil usage, such as cruise lines, that are going bankrupt from Covid. The oil spent on cruises will be a fraction of what is was even two years ago


Nobody is denying that we aren't dependent on oil, but you are severely underestimating how we are quickly finding ways to evolve around oil consumption"

Of course looking back on it, both opinions were correct.  In 98/99 AMZN grew from $13 ti $105, back down to $45 and back to $106 all in a year.  In fall of 2001 it was $6.

AMZN beat expectations on earnings announced 7/30. Call was executed at 3100 at market close on 7/31. So made 5,000 on the difference between my purchase price and execution, and another 8,000 on the options premium.

Ideally, this will give you slightly positive theta on a directionally bullish position.  More importantly, you should be able to afford this.

If AMZN stays flat, you'll make a little from theta decay.  Up, you'll profit handsomely.  Down, you'll lose it all unless AMZN reverses back up before the long exp date.  Good luck."

For context, selling a put will require around $300K to cash secure it. And $35k-$50k to sell it naked on reg-T margin account. 

If you want a bullish strategy on AMZN consider a bullish vertical spread (a put credit or a call debit spread)."

A $10 wide spread of a stock with premiums as good as TSLA is fine. Rule of thumb is to ensure you collect enough premium to  1/3 of the max loss potential

So, for you doing $10 wide spreads max loss would be $1000. You should be getting at least $333.33 in premium for a $10 wide spread.

Personally i stay away from spreads now. I Only sell cash covered puts on stocks I wouldn't mind owning now 

I used to chase high I.V. stocks and do things like open $30 wide put spreads on stocks like SHOP and AMZN. Turned 25k into 67k in 3 months and lost ALL my profit plus a few grand in a single week because i got so cocky with spreads on tech

Some ideas - TGT, WMT, COST, AMD, NVDA, AAPL, TSLA, MSFT, FB, NFLX, AMZN, ADBE, CRM, RH, W. Many of these are on the upswing from dropping 10 to 20% in Sept and are back over their 50 day moving average. Some of them barely dropped at all even during Feb and March - COST has been very strong all year.

I would actually dig into the top 10 to 15 companies of each of those indexes and you will realize that you may just want to buy some of those companies as they are driving most the growth anyway with the rest of the index actually being an anchor to good returns.

I would also create a watch list of companies that you may want to watch to add money to like DAL, CNK, etc as covid restriction loosen up and business picks up. 

I feel like the buy and hold forever paradigm needs to die.  Pick quality stocks and buy when they are at prices you like. Watch them and periodically sell some or all as they become overvalued.  Rebuy once they drop to a more reasonable valuation, rinse and repeat.  This does require more effort but is worth it.

They are able to compete somehow.

What e-commerce does is it kills brick and mortar shops that refuse to get with the times, this is not Amazon. Most likely without Amazon, more small businesses will be killed in terms of net change, this is because most likely Walmart would have been in Amazon's spot and the items on their website used to be 100% sold by Walmart. They only recently opened up to third party sellers as they had to compete with Amazon.

There are businesses that Amazon cannot compete. Amazon is still very small in terms of retail. In fact, Amazon does not really feel that this area is a profitable business for them and hence they are sort of diversifying into other businesses like the cloud and advertising."

12,2020-10-07,g80lv7z,TellTheTruth3,finance,"I think taxing the income is the only way. So that means increasing the taxes paid on capital gains above a certain amount.

13,2020-10-07,g80jk6r,XModz017,finance,">	how do you tax Jeff Bezos when his entire wealth is practically tied up in stock?

It is worth noting Bezos sells off *billions* of dollars in stock every year as is. His wealth is not nearly as illiquid as people claim. In August alone this year Bezos sold off $3+ billion in stock. Taxing his wealth would likely include planned stock sell offs to pay the tax. How this is done is a manner of debate - it could be done gradually over the next year to pay the bill, could be done over a shorter time frame, etc.

There are particular reasons why some argue for both ordinary income level capital gains tax, in addition to a wealth tax. This is because the wealth tax targets some things that capital gains tax does not, such as different time frames. Much of the wealth of someone like Zuckerberg can take decades before it ever gets taxed by traditional means (capital gains, estate, etc).

I would recommend people check out the work of Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman for detailed arguments on these things.

Here is a good intro article by them: http://bostonreview.net/forum/emmanuel-saez-gabriel-zucman-taxing-superrich

And a couple more academic papers: http://gabriel-zucman.eu/files/saez-zucman-wealthtaxobjections.pdf

https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Saez-Zucman_conference-draft.pdf

I would strongly recommend their short book on the history of US taxes, and how to reform it, called *The Triumph of Injustice*:

>	America’s runaway inequality has an engine: our unjust tax system. 

>	Even as they became fabulously wealthy, the ultra-rich have had their taxes collapse to levels last seen in the 1920s. Meanwhile, working-class Americans have been asked to pay more. The Triumph of Injustice presents a forensic investigation into this dramatic transformation, written by two economists who revolutionized the study of inequality. Eschewing anecdotes and case studies, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman offer a comprehensive view of America’s tax system, based on new statistics covering all taxes paid at all levels of government. Their conclusion? For the first time in more than a century, billionaires now pay lower tax rates than their secretaries.

>	Blending history and cutting-edge economic analysis, and writing in lively and jargon-free prose, Saez and Zucman dissect the deliberate choices (and sins of indecision) that have brought us to today: the gradual exemption of capital owners; the surge of a new tax avoidance industry, and the spiral of tax competition among nations. With clarity and concision, they explain how America turned away from the most progressive tax system in history to embrace policies that only serve to compound the wealth of a few.

>	But The Triumph of Injustice is much more than a laser-sharp analysis of one of the great political and intellectual failures of our time. Saez and Zucman propose a visionary, democratic, and practical reinvention of taxes, outlining reforms that can allow tax justice to triumph in today’s globalized world and democracy to prevail over concentrated wealth.

https://wwnorton.com/books/9781324002727

Zucman also wrote a short, highly influential book examining tax havens called *The Hidden Wealth of Nations*:

>	We are well aware of the rise of the 1% as the rapid growth of economic inequality has put the majority of the world’s wealth in the pockets of fewer and fewer. One much-discussed solution to this imbalance is to significantly increase the rate at which we tax the wealthy. But with an enormous amount of the world’s wealth hidden in tax havens—in countries like Switzerland, Luxembourg, and the Cayman Islands—this wealth cannot be fully accounted for and taxed fairly. No one, from economists to bankers to politicians, has been able to quantify exactly how much of the world’s assets are currently hidden—until now. Gabriel Zucman is the first economist to offer reliable insight into the actual extent of the world’s money held in tax havens. And it’s staggering.

>	In The Hidden Wealth of Nations, Zucman offers an inventive and sophisticated approach to quantifying how big the problem is, how tax havens work and are organized, and how we can begin to approach a solution. His research reveals that tax havens are a quickly growing danger to the world economy. In the past five years, the amount of wealth in tax havens has increased over 25%—there has never been as much money held offshore as there is today. This hidden wealth accounts for at least $7.6 trillion, equivalent to 8% of the global financial assets of households. Fighting the notion that any attempts to vanquish tax havens are futile, since some countries will always offer more advantageous tax rates than others, as well the counter-argument that since the financial crisis tax havens have disappeared, Zucman shows how both sides are actually very wrong. In The Hidden Wealth of Nations he offers an ambitious agenda for reform, focused on ways in which countries can change the incentives of tax havens. Only by first understanding the enormity of the secret wealth can we begin to estimate the kind of actions that would force tax havens to give up their practices.

>	Zucman’s work has quickly become the gold standard for quantifying the amount of the world’s assets held in havens. In this concise book, he lays out in approachable language how the international banking system works and the dangerous extent to which the large-scale evasion of taxes is undermining the global market as a whole. If we are to find a way to solve the problem of increasing inequality, The Hidden Wealth of Nations is essential reading.

For example, Amazon is about $3190 right now,  An Oct 16 ATM Call (with Imp Vol of 31%.

) option is $62 or about 1.9% of the stock's price. 

Now, compare that to TSLA, which is very volatile).  TSLA close price is $425, and the same Oct 16 ATM call option (but has an IMP vol of 47) %for them is $15. 15/425 = 3.5%. Because the uncertainty of the stock is higher, the premiums that are demanded are higher as well because more risk is involved in writing options. 

Low volatiltiy = low premiums, high volatility = high premiums."
3,2020-10-09,g86efsf,humbletradesman,options,"More expensive stocks have higher options premiums in terms of absolute dollars, sure. But not necessarily in terms of as a % of the strike price (i.e. something an option seller make take under consideration when making a trade, for example).

For example, as of today’s closing prices, AMZN atm puts for Oct 9, let’s call it an even 3200 strike, are about $24. That is 0.75% of the strike price as premium. If you look at something like AMD for example, the premiums are about 1.3% of strike price for this week’s expiration atm puts. And if you take something like GME which memed today, almost 8% for atm premiums on this week’s puts.

I’ve seen meme stocks with so much IV that weekly atm options premiums were literally 40-50% of the strike price (this phenomenon can often be observed on high IV biotech tickers and the like), and then there are very ‘stable’ stocks where the atm options premiums are barely a fraction of a percent of the strike price. And there is everything in between.

So, as I said, more expensive stocks have higher options premiums in terms of absolute dollars (which, they have to be, if we’re comparing a $100 stock with a $3000 stock, for example), but in terms of looking at the premiums as a % of the strike price, more often than not the lower priced stocks have ‘higher’ options premiums."

It won’t get better than that and it shouldn’t. It will be a lot safer if the robot drove and everyone supervised the robot. All the benefits with even less risk. That’s what I predict. So you can forget about working on a laptop while driving.. that’s a distant fantasy, will be illegal, and will absolve the manufacturer of all liability if an accident happens. In other words: Amazon, Uber, Lyft, etc., their dream of the employee-less employee is a fantasy, it will be legislated out of possibility, for the safety of others, as well as to protect employees."

Their app could use improvements but I think the company has more growth to come for sure. Can you imagine if they had curbside pickup? It’d be a wrap"
2,2020-10-10,g8bncf1,TheBigBingo,investing,"Problem is a lot of the M2 supply that was created is essentially trapped in the capital markets. With the Fed buying corporate bonds and treasuries to keep rates low, the theory is that this encourages companies to expand, thus pulling through to wage increases. Over this years, this has not played. M2 velocity has been slowly decreasing (until its most recent large drop) and the supply of money that’s been increasing essentially goes to inflating equity prices - debt refinancing, stock buybacks, dividends, etc... and inflated home prices through low mortgage rates. Until there is a shift from capital to more of a labor centric corporate strategy, wages will remain more stagnant which will keep velocity down, thus hampering inflation. As an analogy goes, if I create $1T and just put it in a safe, never to be used, then it doesn’t affect the system. That’s essentially what the Fed has done. It’s affecting the credit system but not flowing through to product consumption. If inflation does start to creep into the market, then equities will only benefit. Top-lines will grow along with their earnings. If there is a high inflation environment, then it will tend more to a capital strategy where companies continue their buybacks and different things in order to outpace inflation on a return basis for shareholders and it won’t funnel through to wages as much. Wages will end up increase but will more than likely lag inflation since corporations will be needing to outpace on equity prices. 

The scarier scenario for equities is deflation which is possible in our current environment. If consumer spending doesn’t pick back up, you’ll continue a “K shaped” style recovery where “pandemic winners” (e.g Amazon) will see continued appreciation as investors consolidate in those companies while leaving pandemic losers such as airlines."
3,2020-10-10,g8ayzkw,WittyFault,investing,"BLUF:  You don't seem knowledgeable about AI technology.  I would avoid using any notions you have of understanding AI as a basis for investing.  Some specific point:

>From what I read, it is hard to do complex AI technology. 

I would think it is **hard** to do anything **complex**.  That just seems like defining terms.

>If you look at the successful AI technology today: Self driving by TESLA ... it is the extremely simple AI technology that is done at an incredibly fast pace 

Self driving is actually one of (if not the) most complex AI technologies being heavily funded today.  


>More recently, the most successful complex AI technology story is Tik Tok

Painting TikTok as an AI company is giving them way too much credit.  TikTok is a social media company... key to social media company is network effects not some magical AI.  


>Tik tok search AI is vastly superior to anything in the US at this time.

Is that true?  Is TikTok search better than Google?  Tik Tok ""search AI"" is very similar to Netflix AI, Youtube AI, Facebook AI, Amazon AI, etc.  It is a recommendation engine.   

Microsoft wanted it because that is the core of TikTok... that is where advertisers/users are connected and where the valuable data flows.  If you don't own that, you are essentially an app store front for TikTok.  


>My question is Lemonade insurance claims using Complex AI technology to detect fraud. Is this true?

Sure they are using AI to detect fraud.  Here is a secret, every other insurance company out there is using AI to detect fraud to some degree.  Go to Indeed and search ""data scientist insurance"" and you will see a long list of insurance companies hiring Masters/PhDs for machine learning jobs.


Also, this isn't a very ""complex"" application of AI.  The hardest part of real world AI is the data.  Insurance companies have a very good set of data that is already human curated with the appropriate outcome.


>I find it unlikely that Lemonade has achieved this. If they have, they are worth their stock price for sure. 

What analysis have you done to support their current stock price?"
0,2020-10-10,g8a6kss,ProsaicPansy,options,"When you have a spread and at least one of the two legs of the spread isn’t super actively traded (not sure what volume an OI are on these strikes) then sometimes one of the contracts will move in price because it’s traded and the other will not because no one has traded it during that day. Thus, you’ll see a loss (or gain) that doesn’t represent what you’d get if you actually tried to sell your spread. Almost definitely what is happening here, so it’s not a real loss. 

The other thing that you seem to be missing is an understanding of how the value of the spread will depend not just on the price of a share of amazon, but also implied volatility and time until expiration. The option will be near max profit only when: Stock price is at or above higher strike AND you’re very close to expiration. There are other scenarios where the spread will be close to max profit earlier, like if the stock price goes way above the higher strike and volatility is not very high, but you usually need to hold the spread close to expiration to get the max gain. The reason is that, once both of your options are ITM, you’re long theta (you make more money as time goes by in a non-linear fashion) and short Vega (think about the scenario where implied volatility was zero, then the spread would be at max profit because the stock is not expected to move and the price is at a level where you get max profit.)

If you want to understand how these kind of strategies work, you gotta learn the Greeks. Also, try using a broker like TD Ameritrade with Think or Swim on a computer. Then you can actually visualize the value of the spread at different stock prices at particular dates and levels of IV. 

Make sense now?"
0,2020-10-11,g8e93we,EmperorOfWallStreet,RobinHood,That should be the case but other stuff come in play too like everyone know Amazon will have bumper Holiday season but post holiday quarter may not be that good. That reasoning may drop Amazon price after holiday quarter. Using Amazon just example.
0,2020-10-11,g8i3zht,lies_are_comforting,StockMarket,"Buying in at $15 is only going to be a big mistake if you sell soon. Look at the peaks over the past 6 months. It’s been at $20 over five times. What do you think will happen when a vaccine finally arrives? Or when they report positive earnings news (which they have yet to do and in spite of that fact it’s been at $20 multiple times as I said before)? Or when a new stimulus deal comes? Or when virus numbers decrease severely? Or when holiday shopping begins? 

If you think buying in at $15 was a bad idea, you bought in for the wrong reasons. Patience is key.

0,2020-10-12,g8k9k0n,nowthengoodbad,RobinHood,"I'd like to add a big company that is guaranteed some stability:

AMAT.

Applied Materials does everything semiconductor, from making the machines and processes to developing advanced technologies.

They follow the semiconductor boom and bust that swings up and down over the cycle BUT they give a solid dividend and they literally aren't going away.

Applied Materials is a staple for our future, much like GE was for the last century (but GE was founded on not so great culture and it finally came to a head these past years leading to their collapse).

I'd honestly pick up applied materials over google, Amazon, or Facebook simply because they are a lower cost barrier and you get free money anytime they give their dividend.

I come from a materials science/materials engineering background and know the company fairly well (friends work there too). You're not looking at massive r/WSB gains.... but it's stable and safe for someone new. It's also very easy to get info on the company to do your own due diligence and you likely interact with or own many products that have been associated with their work."
1,2020-10-12,g8jej1b,YoINVESTIGATE_311_,RobinHood,"Beginning with the obvious: DONT DO OPTIONS UNLESS YOU HAVE A GOOD GRASP ON STOCK TRADING AND HAVE A BASIC UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT OPTIONS ARE

Great. Now, several sources believe that the best place to close long options is at a 30% gain. This is a place where you have a strong gain and will see some consistency with wins. You may think that a 30% gain is small. This idea is wrong, many financial experts hope to make 10% ANNUALLY, so 30% off of a single trade should be viewed as an absolute win. 

What stocks you should buy are up to you. If you want to have a easy way to see compound interest in stocks, I would recommend buying a stock with a nice dividend. These stocks teach you to hold a stock which gives good returns, and returns you can see. Some examples for this are SDIV or GEO. Both of these stocks have a dividend rate greater than 10% annually. 

Other stocks that would be smart to buy would be stocks you believe will grow. I’m guessing that you are younger, so I would recommend purchasing stocks for industries that will grow. These are a little bit riskier but in the future may be able to deliver amazing gains. Once again this may require patience and discipline. I won’t lie, I own a lot of SPCE, which is a very risky stock but imo will be extremely valuable in the future.

A great starting place for choosing stocks is companies you’ve heard of like AAPL or AMZN or TM (Toyota). These are just examples of some companies.

Overall, 
Be smart. Don’t be greedy. A win is a win. Don’t get sucked up in stupid stock recommendations (NKLA, SPCE, pennystocks). Don’t expect amazing 1,000$ gains.

Good luck,
I hope you make some money"
2,2020-10-11,g8jay96,Killtrend,RobinHood,"Dude. There’s so much wrong with this post I don’t know where to start. 

You’re a beginner. Stay away from options. 

Stocks are not “unprofitable.” Amazon made 500% returns over 5 years. Microsoft 370% and Apple 329%. Imagine if you put 10k in Microsoft 5 years ago. Can you do the math on that unprofitable trade?

You’re not going to double your money with options. It’s rare for an option to double in value by the time you sell it unless you got an insane entry, bought an ITM leap or got lucky with a catalyst no one knew was coming. 

Investing 200-400 is not enough. You’ll blow your account up and end up burning it. Imagine sitting at a high roller table with $200. They’d take your money in one hand. 

Invest in stocks until you’ve saved up a couple thousand and then you can play around. Until then use Think or Swim and paper trade options to see how you’d actually do. 

Any investor will tell you, don’t gamble more than you’re willing to lose in the blink of an eye. If you have a 1k account you shouldn’t have more to an 200 in options.

1,2020-10-14,g8sw3aw,ArashTopLel,finance,"> However, apparently misguided, I assumed that the people who hold equity in the company usually have more say on the day-to-day decisions compared to the lenders.


A decision to liquidate a company hardly qualifies as a day-to-day decision. Without going into a rabbit hole, covenants prevent this, otherwise there would be absolutely no incentive for equityholders to pay back debt. A simple restrictive covenant, for instance, could mandate unanimous approval from debtholders regarding any major capital structure changes/liquidity events. For day to day operations, covenants may/may not cover that.

&nbsp;

>I thought the role of most lenders is just to get paid their principle+interest unless they convert their debt to shares with voting rights, or force them to file, if the company can't pay them back anymore.


Yea, exactly the idea. See my original comment, if anything debtholders fuck over equityholders in this process.

&nbsp;

> Again, I assumed that debt is used the same way where the equity holders in the company make the day-to-day decisions but also reap the surplus profit, as long as they are able to pay the lenders their agreed upon principal+interest.


Sure, but let's take a look at surplus profit for equityholders. Equityholders get physically paid in dividends and virtually paid in equity value appreciation. The vast majority of the time, you'll see a company NOT pay dividends unless its debt is serviced (i.e dividends are based on net income, which will factor in interest expense there). In the event that a company cannot service its debt, equity holders eat the first loss (no dividends), meanwhile interest is still paid to outstanding debtholders. This is what first loss really means.

&nbsp;

>but exactly how the debt and company gets restructured in ch11 proceedings, I have no idea.

Very complicated, and involves ALOT of negotiation across all stakeholders in the company. In addition, many covenants are NOT publicly available, so you'll be hard pressed to find resources regarding that. In general, a good starting point (if you have access to this) would be to understand an overview to term convergence like the link here:


https://www.shearman.com/-/media/Files/NewsInsights/Publications/2012/07/Term-Loans-and-High-Yield-Bonds-Tracking-the-Con__/Files/View-full-article-Term-Loans-and-High-Yield-Bond__/FileAttachment/TermLoansandHighYieldBondsOSullivanChengFIN071712.pdf


In a VERY simplistic nutshell, restructuring involves any of the following:

1. Asking debtholders to renegotiate softer terms, especially moreso senior debtholders. An example of this would be negotiating a grace period, or altogether forgiving due interest payments.


2. Negotiating with debtholders to convert into equity (very commonly done).


3. Facilitating asset selloffs to service debt and/or cutting operational costs (also very common, this is essentially taking an ""activist"" approach), or in extreme cases mandating a liquidity event, such as M&A, bridge financing, etc. (NOT to be confused with liquidation).


As you can see, this field is very legally oriented and very niche.

> You have liquidation preference backwards. Debtholders force a company  into full liquidation, not equityholders. Equityholders won't get paid  until debtholders are paid (either in whole, or in part + conversion  into equity, etc.) 

I am aware of the system in which bankruptcy pays out by priority, with equity holders being at the last place compared to debt holders.   


However, apparently misguided, I assumed that the people who hold equity in the company usually have more say on the day-to-day decisions compared to the lenders.   


I thought the role of most lenders is just to get paid their principle+interest unless they convert their debt to shares with voting rights, or force them to file, if the company can't pay them back anymore.  


Could you explain how it actually is?  


> Again, equityholders do not do this (they eat first loss) 

Again, I assumed that debt is used the same way where the equity holders in the company make the day-to-day decisions but also reap the surplus profit, as long as they are able to pay the lenders their agreed upon principal+interest.  


Please elaborate!  


> As to the firms for ""imaginary services"" you allude to, most of the  financial firms engage primarily in restructuring advisory, while legal  firms of course undertake both restructuring and liquidation. 

That makes sense given how liquidation is the ""bust"" event, and restructuring is a way to trim fat off the companies books and renegotiate structures to keep it operational.  


> You seem to be conflating filing for restructuring and filing for liquidation (both are ""bankruptcy filings"").   


I'm aware that ch11 is restructuring for the purpose of keeping the business going, and ch7 is a liquidation in the event it doesn't make sense anymore to keep the company operational.  


>Restructuring has significantly more investing opportunity than  liquidation, and has plenty of strategies regarding mainly making plays  on covenant strengths, capital structure, or both 

I assumed that. Post reorganization equity after a restructuring appears to be attractive, but exactly how the debt and company gets restructured in ch11 proceedings, I have no idea.   


I tried asking about the restructuring proceedings in the past, but it appears to be a very convoluted topic as well, but if you would like to go more in-depth I appreciate it.  


> Yes, of course this is a viable business model   
 Tech firms like Amazon do this constantly. 

Are there any resources where I can read about this? I'd ask you to elaborate again, but time is valuable and I feel like the other questions have more meat.   


> On a related note, read up on patent hoarding, as its another way for companies to dry another company (or industry) up. 

I'm aware of patent trolling as a concept, but I always assumed it was more of a way to say ""Fuck you, we have a claim against what you do, so either pay us or we will litigate you until your runway is gone""

> If you go the route of acquiring a majority position and then sell all the assets and reap the profits as the equity holder, are there no consequences for you as an investor during the bankruptcy proceedings? Do you just say eh whatever, fuck all these bond holders?


You have liquidation preference backwards. Debtholders force a company into full liquidation, not equityholders. Equityholders won't get paid until debtholders are paid (either in whole, or in part + conversion into equity, etc.)

&nbsp;

>How do you get yourself the newly acquired capital out of the company before closing shop and filing for liquidation that isn't just paying inflated bills to one of your other firms for imaginary services?


Again, equityholders do not do this (they eat first loss). Debtholders go through a usually very nasty legal process in efforts to recover any amount of outstanding principal. As to the firms for ""imaginary services"" you allude to, most of the financial firms engage primarily in restructuring advisory, while legal firms of course undertake both restructuring and liquidation.

&nbsp;

>If you go the route of buying secured/unsecured debt ahead of a foreseeable filing for liquidation/restructuring, how can you know that the equity holders won't gut all assets and take it out of the company before filing, leaving you in the dirt?


Again, equity holders cannot do this.

&nbsp;

> Are there any accessible resources where I can learn more about the various strategies of maximizing your returns before filings?


You seem to be conflating filing for restructuring and filing for liquidation (both are ""bankruptcy filings""). Restructuring has significantly more investing opportunity than liquidation, and has plenty of strategies regarding mainly making plays on covenant strengths, capital structure, or both (would make sense, one assumes company still a going concern, and the other assumes company out of business).

&nbsp;

>Whether or not this is a realistic business model I can't say, but I would like to learn more about it.


Yes, of course this is a viable business model (not to the degree you mentioned, that's subject to opinion of the end users). Tech firms like Amazon do this constantly. On a related note, read up on patent hoarding, as its another way for companies to dry another company (or industry) up."

3,2020-10-12,g8k5052,ixamnis,stocks,"I have multiple brokerage accounts and I do have on for just investing in ETFs.  Keeping it simple is a pretty solid approach.  However, I'm not thrilled with your choices.  **VOO** and **QQQ** will have a lot of overlap, so you aren't diversifying as much as you might think. **QQQ** is a great ETF, but the underlying index it uses as a benchmark contains 100 stocks.  (The NASDAQ 100).  **VOO** uses the S&P 500, so it obviously contains 500 stocks. Many of the top holdings are going to be the same in both of those ETFs: Apple, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Netflix, Amazon. There are, of course, differences, as well.

I also don't like your choice of **VYM** because of its poor return. It has a 10 year return on investment of just 115%, while VOO is double that and **QQQ** has a return of more than 4 times that of **VYM**. **VYM** will also hold many of the companies you are already investing in with **VOO**.

**QQQ** has one of the highest returns of any ETF, but it is Tech-heavy, so there may be a bit more risk than **VOO**.  

You don't tell us your age, your financial goals and how averse you are to risk, but assuming you are reasonably young (more than 20 years away from retirement) and don't mind some risk, I might suggest a strategy more along the lines of:

**QQQ**: 25%

**VOO**: 25%   (with the understanding that there is some overlap. The blue chip stocks in VOO will help your portfolio to be a little less volatile than putting 50% into QQQ.)

**SOXX:**  10% - iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF - this is a sector ETF that invests in companies that produce semi-conductors (and related companies). The top holdings of this ETF include Broadcom, Intel, NVIDIA, Texas Instruments, Qualcomm, Micron Technology, Taiwan Semiconductor, Analog Devices and NXP Semiconductors.  The might be a little overlap with this one and QQQ, but there shouldn't be much.

**ICLN:**  20% - ICLN is an ETF that invests in green/renewable energy. It is a passively managed index fund that uses the S&P Global Clean Energy Index as its benchmark. Many of its holdings are outside the US.  (If you prefer a more US focused ETF that invests in renewable energy, consider QCLN instead, but be aware that its top holding is NIO, an electric vehicle maker based in China). 

**ARKK:**  10% - The ARK funds are actively managed and they invest in ""disruptive,"" innovative companies, many of which are in the tech sector.  Tesla is the top holding of this fund.

**VXUS**: 10% - This is an investment that tracks the performance of a benchmark index that measures the investment return of stocks issued by companies located in developed and emerging markets, excluding the US. The fund tracks the FTSE all Cap ex US Index fund. Top holdings include Alibaba, Tencent Holdings, Taiwan Semiconductor (a little overlap with SOXX) Nestle, Roche Holding, SAP SE, Novartis, Toyota and ASML.  While the long term track record of this fund isn't great, the recent addition of Alibaba, Tencent and other companies signal a likely more profitable future.

I think an approach like this will give you the additional diversity you are looking for and a more aggressive return than the choices you've made in your post.

3,2020-10-13,g8o44a2,Tristanna,investing,The gains would be so much lower. If you had a 10 year call on AMZN ten years ago you'd have had about a decade of 1.00 delta.
0,2020-10-14,g8rvwt2,begals,options,"Well, good luck to you certainly.  I'd recommend you be willing to take a substantial loss (even if it's 50-75% down) if the remaining value is meaningful to you.  Which is to say, is it worth recouping what's left or is it an inconsequential amount where I might as well write it off as a total loss which once in a blue moon might rocket back up before expiration but which I definitely don't expect to.  For me that tends to be at least-80%+, though even between -80% and -95% it's often worthwhile to get the remaining value back if I'm almost certain it's just lost money anyway.  

As an example, if my average position is worth about $4000 net value and I'm targeting an average 50% ROI, then a position that by all measures looks to be a loser is still worth closing at a loss even at 50-75% or more down, since while that's a lot, if I close down 50% that cancels out one +50% trade, if I let it go to a total loss that's twice as often I need to hit my target just to breakeven.  (Not that 50% per trade should or shouldn't be your target, it's all relative to the risk/reward profile - a +10% target is fine if I'm setup to tolerate very low risk and that can make just as much as the equally fine but more volatile circumstance where I'm hypothetically targeting 250%+ gains, in this case risk is generally pretty high and so I need my gains to compensate for losses appropriately).  Both scenarios can work, and I personally fall somewhere in the middle but with what would generally be regarded as a high risk/reward profile since generally I'm targeting between 35-150% depending on circumstance.  Even then, I'll close some iffy looking positions up 5-10% or even breakeven at times, and if something gains 300% overnight and is trending up, I'm sure as hell not selling until it there's at least some sign of resistance from the market (in a case where upward movement on the underlying is a good thing), though unless I was specifically planning a small investment, low probability, high return trade I'm still going to close out as soon as it begins to lose value for more than a minute or two or does so at an unusually quick rate.  

I should also note I primarily day trade, with 5-15 DTE so that occasionally a day trade will turn into a swing trade or I'll enter some swing trades later in the day; Trading with such little time to expiration significantly increases the inherent risk in market exposure.   If your option expires in 6 months, you don't necessarily have to make such quick decisions if it's up, as the same underlying movement that might turn a +70% position with 3 DTE into a -20% position in just 30 minutes would probably have only a -5% or so max impact on a position of the exact same structure but with 6 months til expiration.   This also should make it apparent why, pretty much across the board everyone will recommend learning on options with at least 2-3 months runway minimum.   Trading short-DTE can definitely be profitable but the risk is substantially higher, news events or presidential tweets will have a much more sizable impact, and you usually have only moments to make the right decision when managing an open position.   That is obviously stressful on its own, but it also is hard to tell what the right move was even after the fact when learning options, since it can be the right move to leave a position open even if it doesn't work out, or the right move to have closed it even if subsequently you would have seen another 200% gain.  Until you're comfortable with your analysis, there's a serious risk of making poor decisions based off feeling like you missed out on a big pay day.   Discipline matters always in options but especially so when day trading short-DTE positions and even more so when they're one-leg directional positions, which are made out to be nothing but gambling, which is usually true for retail traders but not necessarily so.  They just require that much more discipline and experience to have a good chance with.

I guess I say this because it definitely sounds like you have a lone call or put, (and probably a call purchased before around 1-1:30 EST given how you described the change in value - which also suggests you're dealing with a pretty short-DTE option and/or one significantly OTM.  In fact, since you asked about 3,490 I'd guess that's either the strike or your B/E on the underlying.  In either case, I'd recommend you understand completely what effects price, as otherwise you could be in for an unwelcome lesson about how it can be at $3500 and your position can still be down - though on the other hand, it can be at $3470 and you could be up.  It all depends on when you bought it and subsequent changes in IV etc... If you aren't familiar with this concept fully, which the question suggests because hitting 3490 is kind of a meaningless thing without a host of other conditions being met, I'd even more so urge you to take your win or loss tomorrow because even +50% can become -80% sickeningly quickly).  

For anyone really wanting to learn options and make good income, I definitely don't recommend learning in such a trial by fire unless you can take 100% loss 50 times over without being bothered.  The mental resilience to deal with losses without making poor or overly-gambly decisions as a result takes time to build up, so for most people it's far more safe and easy to limit your risk.  

Anyway that's far more than I intended to say, but hopefully that's of some use.   I definitely stand by the idea that if you'd be bothered losing 100% you should just sell on the open and not try to find a best time to sell - Timing the markets with anything more than a very rough amount of accuracy is nearly impossible and even being in the general ballpark is hard for most investors and traders.  Learn on highly optionable underlyings that are trading between $25 and $500 at the absolute max I'd say.  For something like Amazon, the underlying is so high that unless you're able to comfortably learn on a $10-50k position, you're already having to pick options that are way too far OTM and have far too few DTE to even get in on the action.  So, good luck, I hope some of my guesses are wrong but if not please do use caution and be willing to cut your losses, better to live to trade another day."

If you’re familiar with technical analysis, grab AAPL from 2009 to 2019 (both inclusive) and you’ll see the returns have varied widely. Based on the standard deviation, this signals a rather mid-high risks.

Yes Amazon is on a massive track to keep growing but nothing is ever set in stone. I'm sure Ford, GM, and all the legacy carmakers thought the same before Tesla. What I'm getting at is - Amazon can only grow SO large before the tank runs out and theres no more growth. Bezos himself  acknowledges that over and over. 

“I predict one day Amazon will fail. Amazon will go bankrupt.” - Jeff Bezos

""Amazon is not too big to fail,” Bezos said, in a recording of the meeting that CNBC has heard. “In fact, I predict one day Amazon will fail. Amazon will go bankrupt. If you look at large companies, their lifespans tend to be 30-plus years, not a hundred-plus years.” - Nov 15, 2018

8,2020-10-13,g8nuuyo,The_Texidian,stocks,"> Why not? Is something going to replace phones? If new tech comes along, Apple just upgrades its phones.

Because, as u/BenevolentMachine said, new phones come out. Technology moves fast. Apple and other companies also have the problem....people don’t buy new phones every year, most people hold onto their phones for a few years before buying a new one, this makes new phone sales hard to predict and grow. 

Anyway, you can see how Apple is 

A) Trying to keep people in the Apple atmosphere 

And B) Trying to find new revenue streams. 

Apple has been pushing the Apple watch a lot as a fitness item to compete with Fitbit. Apple has been pushing Apple Music now to compete with Spotify. Apple as been making their own music listening devices and so on. Apple even came out with their own Apple credit card that links up with your phone. All of this is to try to get people to buy more apple products so all their devices are linked together. Apple Music and Apple TV also create a monthly revenue source as well. 

From what I can tell, Apple is trying to become more like amazon and do multiple things. Such as health care and entertainment. I can only see apple growing such ventures in the future. 

If Apple were to rely only on phones they’d have to 

A) Increase the price of the phone

B) Sell more of their phones to more people."

2) The market is 'bullish' but that's because of tech stocks which have new ATH every other day. Look at the rest of the stock market: Airlines, energy, entertainment and leisure, financials and real estate is no where close to ATH. It is good value cases in these sectors.  
As well, these growth stocks (Read tech stocks) have a big reason why they thrive during this period. Nobody can go to the mall -> They will order from Amazon. No physcial meetings -> Zoom. Can't go to the cinema, parks etc. -> Watch Netflix for entertainment.. And the list goes on.

0,2020-10-15,g8v4i1p,bigj4155,stocks," **This seems to help most people wrap their head around a margin account.**

Edit : I keep this comment handy to answer this question when it comes up.

Edit 2 : Keep in mind you are only charged interest if you hold the stock over night. So day trading is a bit of a loop hole as you never really hold over night. Ive traded value wise millions of dollars. But that is pretty darn easy when I buy 400 DIS shares at $130 = $52k but then sell it 30 seconds later. And then buy it again 5 minutes later on the next leg up where I would sell it again on the next leg down and then buy it again at the high to then sell it at the low. :) So far in my margin account I have something like $25 dollars worth of interest charges.

I have just went through the woods on this ""well kind of I started 8 months ago on learning wtf Im doing"" Now let me preface this with : All brokers are different. I use E-Trade so TD may vary a bit.

Once you are a margin account you are always a margin account. Once you are a PDT you are always a PDT. You have to jump through some hops to change back down to a cash account. Now lets run through a quick example.

Cash Value account : $30,000

Margin Value with above account : Cash value $30,000 + margin $60,000 = $90000

If this account is PDT depends on how you trade. More than 3 ""I think"" same day trades in a rolling 5 trading day span auto converts you to a PDT account.

\-Trade 1 : 100 shares of MSFT at $150 = $15,000 ==== $5000 against your cash and $10,000 on margin. Cash value in your account is now $25000.

With that trade because your TOTAL shares are valued below you $30k cash value you do not get charged margin interest.

\-Trade 2 ""while holding trade 1 still"" : 1000 shares of PENN at $13 = $13000 ==== $4300ish against your cash and $8600 on margin. Cash value in your account is now $21000.

So with the 2 trades above you have roughly $27000 worth of stocks. However your Cash value is $30000 so you do not get charged margin interest.

\-Trade 3 ""while still holding trade 1 and 2"" : 10 shares of AMZN at $2400 = $24000 === $8000 against your cash and $16000 on margin. Cash Value in your account is now $13000

HOWEVER you now have $15k + $13k + $24k = $42k worth of stock so $12000 on loan from your broker. You get charged margin interest on $12k PER DAY! So with E-Trade that is 8% so with some quick ""probably wrong"" math we get

$12000 \* .8 = $960

$960 / 360 ""360 why they calc 360 and not 365 I do not know"" = $2.66

So to borrow $12000 is $2.66 per day. Really not to bad but can get out of hand REAL fast. get stuck in a trade that you ate shit on and then the stock gets a halt like Linkin Coffee and you are paying interest to not even be able to trade and take the fucking lose.

Happy trading sir!

p.s - to answer one of your questions directly. No you can not pick and choose how to spend the money in your account. Once a margin account you are buying on margin. Just dont buy more than your cash value :)"

Buy at a good price.

He keeps saying it ""if the price is right"".

Anyone who invests in the right thing at the right time can X up their investment.

From Daytraders, to private equity holders, to bankers, to long term stock or bond holders to mister Gates grabbing the code for an OS at cheap or mister Bezos stuffing his paychecks into a bunch of boxes a website and shipping Books out 20 hours a day.

&#x200B;

All these ""how to do it"" videos come down to a cold hard truth.

How do you know when the right time is, what the right price is, and what the right company/commodity/whatever is? 

And that is it. 

If you could get that right on a consistent basis you will grow wealth. 

And the issue with that is, if that would be an ability or skill that can be explained in a video, a book, a class, a whatever, people could copy, apply and consistently get rich.

It is not.

The same things Buffet did would not have worked for Bezos, etc. ...

The reason your question doesn't make sense is that you don't buy stocks, you buy shares. Different companies have a different amount of shares and the number of shares can change. If a company has 100 outstanding shares and you own 2 shares; that means you own 2% of the company. Meanwhile, Amazon has like 500 million outstanding shares so each share is a smaller piece of the pie, however amazon is a very large pie.


Most people don't really consider how much of the company they own; rather, how much of their portfolio they have invested."
1,2020-10-16,g8ycms6,rmh1128,stocks,"Your probably gonna get different answers bud as there is no secret. Depends on how much your are fine with losing .  There are safer stocks like amazon that you are pretty safe investing in but your not gonna make a ton unless you have a lot to invest.  If your investing to get rich off some random stock that you hope goes up then save your money.  Think about what is big in the world i.e. EV, hence NIO, do your research and start small bud.  My wife bought 100 shares of NIO back in February when it was like 2 or 3 bucks a share.  She did her research and now she thinks she is warren buffet.

Keep adding amazon they will be 4k pretty soon. Look at other e-commerce company the growth they had wayfair/overstock. Amazon is far from that and they are doing really good in aws."
3,2020-10-16,g8ywi1n,EightFolding,stocks,"One way to approach this is to spread your money out yourself over the price fluctuations. Make sure you don't pay any trading fees, then buy a little. Create a watch list where you can track the price at the moment you added it to the list. Pay attention to the price you pay today. If it goes down, buy more. Buy more every time it's red, every time it's less than you originally paid for it, or even when it drops for the day. Eventually yes, it will drop a lot, then you buy more. And then it will go up again. Buy as low as you can whenever you can rather than buying all at once, if you can. This might be a good approach with Amazon.

But Apple pays a dividend. So you could also buy a larger amount now, enrol in DRIP, and let the dividends buy more for you at whatever the price of the day is. Then buy more later when it drops, if you want. Either way, the dividend will keep averaging the price for you over time. If you hold for a long time and they keep paying a dividend.

But don't be surprised to see Apple drop to 90, or lower at some point. I've held it for a long time and like every equity it has ups and downs. And the price to earnings is really high at the moment.  In 2007 at the peak Apple's P/E was 37, then it dropped to 9.8. It hasn't been that high since, until now when once again the P/E is 36... So, don't be surprised if it and lots of other equities like it fall off a cliff at some point and then climb back up.

If you're looking for a company that will do as well as Apple did in the past, but in the future, look for one with a low P/E like that *now*."
