>From what I read, it is hard to do complex AI technology. 

I would think it is **hard** to do anything **complex**.  That just seems like defining terms.

>If you look at the successful AI technology today: Self driving by TESLA ... it is the extremely simple AI technology that is done at an incredibly fast pace 

Self driving is actually one of (if not the) most complex AI technologies being heavily funded today.  


>More recently, the most successful complex AI technology story is Tik Tok

Painting TikTok as an AI company is giving them way too much credit.  TikTok is a social media company... key to social media company is network effects not some magical AI.  


>Tik tok search AI is vastly superior to anything in the US at this time.

Is that true?  Is TikTok search better than Google?  Tik Tok ""search AI"" is very similar to Netflix AI, Youtube AI, Facebook AI, Amazon AI, etc.  It is a recommendation engine.   

Microsoft wanted it because that is the core of TikTok... that is where advertisers/users are connected and where the valuable data flows.  If you don't own that, you are essentially an app store front for TikTok.  


>My question is Lemonade insurance claims using Complex AI technology to detect fraud. Is this true?

Sure they are using AI to detect fraud.  Here is a secret, every other insurance company out there is using AI to detect fraud to some degree.  Go to Indeed and search ""data scientist insurance"" and you will see a long list of insurance companies hiring Masters/PhDs for machine learning jobs.


Also, this isn't a very ""complex"" application of AI.  The hardest part of real world AI is the data.  Insurance companies have a very good set of data that is already human curated with the appropriate outcome.


>I find it unlikely that Lemonade has achieved this. If they have, they are worth their stock price for sure. 

What analysis have you done to support their current stock price?"

0,2020-10-14,g8tbigj,Gimme_Karma_please,investing,"Yes, but what if his wife signed the NDA and Gary made the deal? that was totally out of Bill Gates control.  Bill Gates was a genius who made something great, but a lot of other things out of his control happened that augmented his success and it'd be foolish to pretend otherwise"
1,2020-10-14,g8tazmq,WarrenMuppet007,investing,">Gary Kildall

The guy who actully developed the OS .  
Funny story, when IBM approached Bill Gates for an OS , Bill sent them to Gary and informed Gary someone important is coming (as he cannot name them because of NDA) and told him they are important people.   
What did Gary do ? fucked off to fly his aircraft.  


When IBM executives reached Gary's home , his wife refused to sign NDA and they left. Subsequently they IBM went back to Bill Gates.   


Now we can say Bill Gates got lucky because Gary Kildall thought it was a good idea to not take Bill's info lightly."
2,2020-10-14,g8t9qq3,Gimme_Karma_please,investing,"they did get lucky though.  I don't hate on them at all, but Gary Kildall was probably just as smart as bill gates and he didn't make it big."
3,2020-10-14,g8taxqb,Gimme_Karma_please,investing,"If you work hard or create something great, you will be successful, but things happen, and if Gary Kildall didn't have an accident, he probably would've been just as big as bill gates, and many athletes and artists' successes were defined by a single moment or a single piece of art, and a lot of othersare probably equally talented but didn't make it big.  BlocBoy would never have been famous if Look alive didn't become a hit, and Philip Rivers is very skilled but still didn't win a super bowl."
4,2020-10-14,g8s0vov,WarrenMuppet007,investing,">I suggest you buy producing assets, like real estate or businesses, after paying off high interest debts

Bruh.. Bezos and Gates did this exact thing that they bought asset producing businesses with their blood and sweat. And ""poor"" people hate them for being ~~millionaires~~ billionaires.

Never tell me rich people got lucky."

don't worry, 90% of the shitcoins won't make it in the long run. Only Bitcoin and maybe a few other altcoins will make it

> Compare that to Bitcoin or cryptos, and see the difference. Just what aspect of our lives did cryptos change? Do we order shit through cryptos? Do we communicate via cryptos? Do we spend our leisure time using cryptos? 

you must live in a country with low inflation. Please go try to live in a one of the many countries with double digit inflation. You also may have more freedom in your country to bring other currencies in and out of the country, consider some do not have this liesure and the citizens who fly out and come back with physical gold end up with it confinscated. Bitcoin can cross borders"

Furthermore, in 2001, Internet was already a massively transformative technology that changed how the entire world lives. The groundwork for a new tech renaissance was already set.

Because the Internet did all that by 2001 already."
