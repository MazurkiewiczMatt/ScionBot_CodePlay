I think they are a very well run business and making great moves by acquiring Signal Sciences and expanding into security as well. I think there client base speaks for itself and they are going to be a big part of making web traffic continue to stay fast and be faster. Google partnership is good.

3,2020-10-10,g8awzfu,Schieldsy,investing,"For the insurance industry the ability to explain neural networks which produce outputs is the real issue.

Google ""Explainable AI"" or ""XAI"".

People go on about complex AI but really most are using open source tools like TensorFlow and often it's their access to data which defines their edge.

In financial services XAI is desperately needed."
4,2020-10-10,g8ayzkw,WittyFault,investing,"BLUF:  You don't seem knowledgeable about AI technology.  I would avoid using any notions you have of understanding AI as a basis for investing.  Some specific point:

>From what I read, it is hard to do complex AI technology. 

I would think it is **hard** to do anything **complex**.  That just seems like defining terms.

>If you look at the successful AI technology today: Self driving by TESLA ... it is the extremely simple AI technology that is done at an incredibly fast pace 

Self driving is actually one of (if not the) most complex AI technologies being heavily funded today.  


>More recently, the most successful complex AI technology story is Tik Tok

Painting TikTok as an AI company is giving them way too much credit.  TikTok is a social media company... key to social media company is network effects not some magical AI.  


>Tik tok search AI is vastly superior to anything in the US at this time.

Is that true?  Is TikTok search better than Google?  Tik Tok ""search AI"" is very similar to Netflix AI, Youtube AI, Facebook AI, Amazon AI, etc.  It is a recommendation engine.   

Microsoft wanted it because that is the core of TikTok... that is where advertisers/users are connected and where the valuable data flows.  If you don't own that, you are essentially an app store front for TikTok.  


>My question is Lemonade insurance claims using Complex AI technology to detect fraud. Is this true?

Sure they are using AI to detect fraud.  Here is a secret, every other insurance company out there is using AI to detect fraud to some degree.  Go to Indeed and search ""data scientist insurance"" and you will see a long list of insurance companies hiring Masters/PhDs for machine learning jobs.


Also, this isn't a very ""complex"" application of AI.  The hardest part of real world AI is the data.  Insurance companies have a very good set of data that is already human curated with the appropriate outcome.


>I find it unlikely that Lemonade has achieved this. If they have, they are worth their stock price for sure. 

What analysis have you done to support their current stock price?"

2,2020-10-13,g8n4e9t,babyshanks,investing,"But the point is renewables are not a growing market. They appear to be, based on the perception of the public, which is based on the lies of politicians.

As we transition to renewables, we will start to realise how unreliable they are and how destructive they are to our immediate environment. California is having brownouts because the renewable energy supply they are hellbent on transitioning to just doesn’t stand up to the fossil fuel supply. Renewables are more expensive than we think, cause more damage than we think, and are made and maintained from entirely in unrenewable materials and processes.

Another thing.. passenger cars make up just 6% of our co2 emissions. If we transition to EV’s, we are not reducing our co2 emissions.. we are actually increasing them because we emit more co2 through the generation of the electricity used to charge these EV’s than we do through the use of internal combustion engines. We are not getting rid of the problem, we are just moving it back down the production line and magnifying it.

WTI will lose value because the public believe oil is bad. The pressure the leftist are putting on companies like BP to go green are forcing them to make these outrageous targets that will ultimately kill their business. This will increase the price of Brent oil in the long term.

I’m not sure how V2G will do anything productive. It allows you to sell the electricity stored in your car’s battery back to the grid.. well now you have no car to drive. 

You will need a constant supply of copper, silver, nickel, iron ore and uranium if you want clean energy (plus many more rare earth metals). You will need coal, oil and gas to mine, transport and manufacture the equipment required to produce this “renewable” energy. This equipment will require a constant supply of these metals for maintenance and replacements.

So over the next, let’s say, 10 years for argument sake. You’re going to see a reduction in the supply of gas, oil, and coal as we use them to mine the materials needed for this supposedly “green” revolution we are heading toward. This will increase the price of these commodities. After 10 years the public may realise that renewables aren’t actually that renewable and that the science and maths behind anthropogenic climate change doesn’t quite make sense anymore.. and we will shift back to our reliance on coal, oil and gas.. which the world absolutely relies on. Which will increase the demand and therefore the price.

Tesla’s batteries are good if you need to supply a few thousand homes for a couple of hours.. not the entirety of Europe, the factories and the electric cars forever..

Again.. buy rare earth metals and commodities while they are cheap. Is it so hard to believe the politicians are lying to you? Do you really think all these Russian and Middle Eastern oil tycoons are investing in Tesla and Google? Or are they investing in mining companies and commodities? Who wins at the end of all this? The public or the elites?

Copy the investments of the elites."
3,2020-10-11,g8gixk8,__TSLA__,investing,">Coal is in its death throe for sure. It's almost game over. 

>But renewables are not stopping here as their cost keeps falling. Once enough battery storage becomes available, it's only a matter of time before NG falls as well.

Energy is a stupendous large addressable market of well over a trillion dollars of revenue per year, and much of it is still fossil fuel dominated.

So the disruption is both huge and unavoidable - hence the growth premiums for renewable stocks.

The growth of Apple, Google & Amazon will seem like a child's play."
