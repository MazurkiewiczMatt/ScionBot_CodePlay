You're claiming to have bought Apple at a time they had Apple stores, and also at a time that a 15% discount on their stock price was making it $4.50 a share?"
0,2020-10-11,g8g9w9k,JeffB1517,investing,"You are right it is in both of those ETFs so you can subtract from either.  
Your problem is you don't have an asset allocation.  The first step is asset allocation.  

Apple is 

* large cap USA growth 
* primarily global consumer discretionary exposure 
* secondarily technology exposure
* quality exposure

Right now with 2 buckets just subtract proportionally from both and move on."
1,2020-10-11,g8g8tpx,scoutswan,investing,"So for example, if I had SPY and ARKF and I really like Apple. So I also bought some AAPL shares. But both those ETFs have exposure to AAPL. This is where I’m having trouble weighting it. I don’t think I’d want to diversify to 20 stocks when I could just go full SPY. Which I don’t want to."
2,2020-10-11,g8fzj09,FunnyPhrases,investing,"The problem isn't debt per se, but deficits. If you keep running deficits with no end in sight, you're basically telling creditors they'll never get paid back into perpetuity. That weakens confidence in the currency, which causes inflation and raises borrowing costs.

When debt exceeds GDP (i.e. revenue), it's sort of an uh-oh moment for creditors. Yes they can technically pay it back with printed money, which is the basic premise of MMT; but MMT relies on politicians raising taxes to counter inflation from printing money when necessary, which clearly is not a rational expectation. 

The other problem is that the USD is a reserve currency. So unlike JPY, there is significant foreign ownership of US debt (30%), and the US implicitly runs a current account deficit (Japan has a CA surplus). So it's not an apples-to-apples comparison to say that just because Japan did fine with 200% debt to GDP means other Western counterparts will do fine too."

>But renewables are not stopping here as their cost keeps falling. Once enough battery storage becomes available, it's only a matter of time before NG falls as well.

Energy is a stupendous large addressable market of well over a trillion dollars of revenue per year, and much of it is still fossil fuel dominated.

So the disruption is both huge and unavoidable - hence the growth premiums for renewable stocks.

The growth of Apple, Google & Amazon will seem like a child's play."
4,2020-10-11,g8f0svi,CarRamRob,investing,"There is no “signal” in stock splits. 

Tesla and Apple are the outliers, not the rule. 

Saying that: 
Stocks that split generally are doing well (going up) and continue to do so. 
Stocks that reverse split are generally doing poor (going down) and continue to do so."

investing... i assume long term would be VO, VOO, QQQ, or aything related to S&P?"
1,2020-10-12,g8lphu0,DT02178,investing,"I did before I learned investing made me more than trading. I own funds, bonds and equity, for most of our assets. I still have a few trades that turned into investments, Google, Apple, Tesla have made us a bunch of money."

3,2020-10-12,g8jof3a,Dwigt_Schroot,investing,"I think high speed refers to 5G phone? Long term, there’s no doubt in anyone’s mind that AAPL will do well. I still think that post split run up in stock was non-sensical. If you bought below $90-80, then congrats. Do your research before buying here though"
0,2020-10-13,g8nz265,HallucinatoryFrog,investing,"Pre-market doesn't mean much.  It's rare to see a million shares of volume for a ticker in after hours trading, and even then it's not an indication of how the day will pan out.

Today was a great example.  AAPL had 4 million shares being sold pre-market.  The stock price went vertical at the opening bell.  By COB (close of business) 240 million shares were bought."
1,2020-10-13,g8opiw9,kavmeister,investing,"That's a bad analogy because there's no technological redundancy. A better comparison is with restaurants: you can cook dinner at home but there's still a big market for eating out. People still like going to the cinema for the experience.

Yes there is a big and growing market for on-demand content at home and sure that will canabalise some cinemagoing. But if some big ticket movies released exclusively to cinemas there's still scope for cinemas to succeed. How many is anyone's guess. But if a company like Disney stepped in to buy strategic locations in a selloff, there's plenty of reasons that could make them a lot of money."
2,2020-10-13,g8ormyo,CarRamRob,investing,"Yes, I didn’t touch on that.  The reason they are below book value is that investors are anticipating their reserves are overbooked a bit right now.  But even if they take a cut, those 
“reserves” are converted to resource and aren’t going anywhere and can be rebooked at higher prices potentially.  Their current reserve life is around 15 years

That’s not a great investing premise, I’ll give you that, but consider it this way, even if their book value is ~1, that means they are fully valued for getting out all their available reserves they currently have, and assumes they will never find a newer drop of oil.  They employe thousands of people who’s job it is to find better reservoirs and develop them at cheaper costs.  It’d be like assuming Apple wouldn’t create another iphone, or Verizon wouldn’t build another Cell tower.  

Just because it’s not on their books today means you have to expect 0 growth past what they have booked, which means you have limited downside.

I do prefer Chevron to XOM myself fwiw."

1,2020-10-14,g8tdkgs,x2c3v4b5,investing,"No, a “financial advisor” who sells cookie cutter products and provides cookie cutter advice based upon pre-determined risk tolerance questions is used for the management of wealth. 

The therapist is for when OP overindulges in alcohol and drugs, gets a divorce letter from their partner who is trying to take away half of their shit, and for all the ruined relationships of family and friends who he never helped financially even though they begged and thought that they were entitled to free shit because they were family and friends."

0,2020-10-16,g8zpy7j,CliftonHanger001,investing,"You learned a valuable lesson at the ripe young age of 26. I know it's gut wrenching but take this lesson and move forward - you have what it takes to be super successful. To wit:

\-You have incredible work ethic work hard and save $40K in a year

\-You have the gagoozies to take a chance

This is a winning combination. The future is bright - you will be successful. My only advice is to invest in things you understand. For me it's great companies like Apple, Tesla, Square, etc. Crypto is great for buying drugs online but probs not for investing."
1,2020-10-16,g8zbrx0,Aggressive_Income,investing,"I lost like 22g's earlier this year. Guess what I don't do now? Make crazy risky bets. My money is in savings, I have some ""play money"" in my investment account and I do NOT add more money to my losses. I learn to trade the little I have until I build it back up. Now I have a few shares of BOA and a share of Apple. 

Don't worry about it man, you lost a year of money at 26. It's way better than losing 10-20-30 years of savings that your wife and kids needed and depended on. This is a wonderful lesson to learn early and you can get back up literally in 12 months which is annoying but not as bad as it could be.

Stay strong and good vibes to you man. I hope you start feeling good again soon, it took me a few weeks or a couple months to feel enough distance from the event"
