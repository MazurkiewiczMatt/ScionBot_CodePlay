AMAT.

Applied Materials does everything semiconductor, from making the machines and processes to developing advanced technologies.

They follow the semiconductor boom and bust that swings up and down over the cycle BUT they give a solid dividend and they literally aren't going away.

Applied Materials is a staple for our future, much like GE was for the last century (but GE was founded on not so great culture and it finally came to a head these past years leading to their collapse).

I'd honestly pick up applied materials over google, Amazon, or Facebook simply because they are a lower cost barrier and you get free money anytime they give their dividend.

I come from a materials science/materials engineering background and know the company fairly well (friends work there too).

Great. Now, several sources believe that the best place to close long options is at a 30% gain. This is a place where you have a strong gain and will see some consistency with wins. You may think that a 30% gain is small. This idea is wrong, many financial experts hope to make 10% ANNUALLY, so 30% off of a single trade should be viewed as an absolute win. 

What stocks you should buy are up to you. If you want to have a easy way to see compound interest in stocks, I would recommend buying a stock with a nice dividend. These stocks teach you to hold a stock which gives good returns, and returns you can see. Some examples for this are SDIV or GEO. Both of these stocks have a dividend rate greater than 10% annually. 

Other stocks that would be smart to buy would be stocks you believe will grow. I’m guessing that you are younger, so I would recommend purchasing stocks for industries that will grow. These are a little bit riskier but in the future may be able to deliver amazing gains. Once again this may require patience and discipline. I won’t lie, I own a lot of SPCE, which is a very risky stock but imo will be extremely valuable in the future.

A great starting place for choosing stocks is companies you’ve heard of like AAPL or AMZN or TM (Toyota). These are just examples of some companies.

Overall, 
Be smart. Don’t be greedy. A win is a win. Don’t get sucked up in stupid stock recommendations (NKLA, SPCE, pennystocks). Don’t expect amazing 1,000$ gains.

You’re a beginner. Stay away from options. 

Stocks are not “unprofitable.” Amazon made 500% returns over 5 years. Microsoft 370% and Apple 329%. Imagine if you put 10k in Microsoft 5 years ago. Can you do the math on that unprofitable trade?

You’re not going to double your money with options. It’s rare for an option to double in value by the time you sell it unless you got an insane entry, bought an ITM leap or got lucky with a catalyst no one knew was coming. 

Investing 200-400 is not enough. You’ll blow your account up and end up burning it. Imagine sitting at a high roller table with $200. They’d take your money in one hand. 

Invest in stocks until you’ve saved up a couple thousand and then you can play around. Until then use Think or Swim and paper trade options to see how you’d actually do. 

Any investor will tell you, don’t gamble more than you’re willing to lose in the blink of an eye. If you have a 1k account you shouldn’t have more to an 200 in options.

1,2020-10-14,g8sw3aw,ArashTopLel,finance,"> However, apparently misguided, I assumed that the people who hold equity in the company usually have more say on the day-to-day decisions compared to the lenders.


A decision to liquidate a company hardly qualifies as a day-to-day decision. Without going into a rabbit hole, covenants prevent this, otherwise there would be absolutely no incentive for equityholders to pay back debt. A simple restrictive covenant, for instance, could mandate unanimous approval from debtholders regarding any major capital structure changes/liquidity events. For day to day operations, covenants may/may not cover that.

&nbsp;

>I thought the role of most lenders is just to get paid their principle+interest unless they convert their debt to shares with voting rights, or force them to file, if the company can't pay them back anymore.


Yea, exactly the idea. See my original comment, if anything debtholders fuck over equityholders in this process.

&nbsp;

> Again, I assumed that debt is used the same way where the equity holders in the company make the day-to-day decisions but also reap the surplus profit, as long as they are able to pay the lenders their agreed upon principal+interest.


Sure, but let's take a look at surplus profit for equityholders. Equityholders get physically paid in dividends and virtually paid in equity value appreciation. The vast majority of the time, you'll see a company NOT pay dividends unless its debt is serviced (i.e dividends are based on net income, which will factor in interest expense there). In the event that a company cannot service its debt, equity holders eat the first loss (no dividends), meanwhile interest is still paid to outstanding debtholders. This is what first loss really means.

&nbsp;

>but exactly how the debt and company gets restructured in ch11 proceedings, I have no idea.

Very complicated, and involves ALOT of negotiation across all stakeholders in the company. In addition, many covenants are NOT publicly available, so you'll be hard pressed to find resources regarding that. In general, a good starting point (if you have access to this) would be to understand an overview to term convergence like the link here:


https://www.shearman.com/-/media/Files/NewsInsights/Publications/2012/07/Term-Loans-and-High-Yield-Bonds-Tracking-the-Con__/Files/View-full-article-Term-Loans-and-High-Yield-Bond__/FileAttachment/TermLoansandHighYieldBondsOSullivanChengFIN071712.pdf


In a VERY simplistic nutshell, restructuring involves any of the following:

1. Asking debtholders to renegotiate softer terms, especially moreso senior debtholders. An example of this would be negotiating a grace period, or altogether forgiving due interest payments.


2. Negotiating with debtholders to convert into equity (very commonly done).


3. Facilitating asset selloffs to service debt and/or cutting operational costs (also very common, this is essentially taking an ""activist"" approach), or in extreme cases mandating a liquidity event, such as M&A, bridge financing, etc. (NOT to be confused with liquidation).


As you can see, this field is very legally oriented and very niche.

&nbsp;

>Are there any resources where I can read about this? I'd ask you to elaborate again, but time is valuable and I feel like the other questions have more meat.

I am aware of the system in which bankruptcy pays out by priority, with equity holders being at the last place compared to debt holders.   


However, apparently misguided, I assumed that the people who hold equity in the company usually have more say on the day-to-day decisions compared to the lenders.   


I thought the role of most lenders is just to get paid their principle+interest unless they convert their debt to shares with voting rights, or force them to file, if the company can't pay them back anymore.  


Could you explain how it actually is?

Again, I assumed that debt is used the same way where the equity holders in the company make the day-to-day decisions but also reap the surplus profit, as long as they are able to pay the lenders their agreed upon principal+interest.  


Please elaborate!  


> As to the firms for ""imaginary services"" you allude to, most of the  financial firms engage primarily in restructuring advisory, while legal  firms of course undertake both restructuring and liquidation. 

That makes sense given how liquidation is the ""bust"" event, and restructuring is a way to trim fat off the companies books and renegotiate structures to keep it operational.  


> You seem to be conflating filing for restructuring and filing for liquidation (both are ""bankruptcy filings"").   


I'm aware that ch11 is restructuring for the purpose of keeping the business going, and ch7 is a liquidation in the event it doesn't make sense anymore to keep the company operational.  


>Restructuring has significantly more investing opportunity than  liquidation, and has plenty of strategies regarding mainly making plays  on covenant strengths, capital structure, or both 

I assumed that. Post reorganization equity after a restructuring appears to be attractive, but exactly how the debt and company gets restructured in ch11 proceedings, I have no idea.   


I tried asking about the restructuring proceedings in the past, but it appears to be a very convoluted topic as well, but if you would like to go more in-depth I appreciate it.

&nbsp;

>How do you get yourself the newly acquired capital out of the company before closing shop and filing for liquidation that isn't just paying inflated bills to one of your other firms for imaginary services?


Again, equityholders do not do this (they eat first loss). Debtholders go through a usually very nasty legal process in efforts to recover any amount of outstanding principal. As to the firms for ""imaginary services"" you allude to, most of the financial firms engage primarily in restructuring advisory, while legal firms of course undertake both restructuring and liquidation.

&nbsp;

>If you go the route of buying secured/unsecured debt ahead of a foreseeable filing for liquidation/restructuring, how can you know that the equity holders won't gut all assets and take it out of the company before filing, leaving you in the dirt?


Again, equity holders cannot do this.

&nbsp;

> Are there any accessible resources where I can learn more about the various strategies of maximizing your returns before filings?


You seem to be conflating filing for restructuring and filing for liquidation (both are ""bankruptcy filings""). Restructuring has significantly more investing opportunity than liquidation, and has plenty of strategies regarding mainly making plays on covenant strengths, capital structure, or both (would make sense, one assumes company still a going concern, and the other assumes company out of business).

I think the large retailers will continue to do fine - stimulus or no.

2,2020-10-12,g8lh7kr,ixamnis,stocks,"I'm very bullish on Amazon, so I own some FDIS. I also like most of the other companies in the top 10 holdings.  FDIS is 32% Amazon. It gives me exposure to Home Depot, Lowe's, Tesla, Nike, Starbucks, Target, etc.  I'm bullish on all of those companies.  Excellent ETF, in my opinion, but I wouldn't make it more than about 20% or 25% of my portfolio.  In my case it's less than 5%, but I'm increasing my holdings in FDIS.  

I like the recent addition of Tesla, although it's something of an odd holding, in my opinion for a ""Consumer Discretionary"" fund."
3,2020-10-12,g8k5052,ixamnis,stocks,"I have multiple brokerage accounts and I do have on for just investing in ETFs.  Keeping it simple is a pretty solid approach.  However, I'm not thrilled with your choices.  **VOO** and **QQQ** will have a lot of overlap, so you aren't diversifying as much as you might think. **QQQ** is a great ETF, but the underlying index it uses as a benchmark contains 100 stocks.  (The NASDAQ 100).  **VOO** uses the S&P 500, so it obviously contains 500 stocks. Many of the top holdings are going to be the same in both of those ETFs: Apple, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Netflix, Amazon. There are, of course, differences, as well.

I also don't like your choice of **VYM** because of its poor return. It has a 10 year return on investment of just 115%, while VOO is double that and **QQQ** has a return of more than 4 times that of **VYM**. **VYM** will also hold many of the companies you are already investing in with **VOO**.

**QQQ** has one of the highest returns of any ETF, but it is Tech-heavy, so there may be a bit more risk than **VOO**.  

You don't tell us your age, your financial goals and how averse you are to risk, but assuming you are reasonably young (more than 20 years away from retirement) and don't mind some risk, I might suggest a strategy more along the lines of:

**QQQ**: 25%

**VOO**: 25%   (with the understanding that there is some overlap. The blue chip stocks in VOO will help your portfolio to be a little less volatile than putting 50% into QQQ.)

**SOXX:**  10% - iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF - this is a sector ETF that invests in companies that produce semi-conductors (and related companies). The top holdings of this ETF include Broadcom, Intel, NVIDIA, Texas Instruments, Qualcomm, Micron Technology, Taiwan Semiconductor, Analog Devices and NXP Semiconductors.  The might be a little overlap with this one and QQQ, but there shouldn't be much.

**ICLN:**  20% - ICLN is an ETF that invests in green/renewable energy. It is a passively managed index fund that uses the S&P Global Clean Energy Index as its benchmark. Many of its holdings are outside the US.  (If you prefer a more US focused ETF that invests in renewable energy, consider QCLN instead, but be aware that its top holding is NIO, an electric vehicle maker based in China). 

**ARKK:**  10% - The ARK funds are actively managed and they invest in ""disruptive,"" innovative companies, many of which are in the tech sector.  Tesla is the top holding of this fund.

**VXUS**: 10% - This is an investment that tracks the performance of a benchmark index that measures the investment return of stocks issued by companies located in developed and emerging markets, excluding the US. The fund tracks the FTSE all Cap ex US Index fund. Top holdings include Alibaba, Tencent Holdings, Taiwan Semiconductor (a little overlap with SOXX) Nestle, Roche Holding, SAP SE, Novartis, Toyota and ASML.  While the long term track record of this fund isn't great, the recent addition of Alibaba, Tencent and other companies signal a likely more profitable future.

I think an approach like this will give you the additional diversity you are looking for and a more aggressive return than the choices you've made in your post.

1,2020-10-13,g8nk21f,sacrefist,investing,">Companies are starting to realize that they can’t rely on a middleman anymore.

Well, maybe this move makes a market for independent film distribution on some streaming network. Amazon has promoted independent publishing through Kindle. Maybe Amazon can also promote independent filmmakers through Prime Video."
2,2020-10-13,g8nv5ys,Monir5265,investing,"That’s true and it’s a risk that can’t be brushed off easily. My reasoning is that after watching all of Chamath palihapitiya interviews, it seems to me like he truly understands tech and business. Some of the “cloud and AI” companies today are often led by a management team who doesn’t understand tech. Same thing happened in 99 where ceos saw how stocks rose as soon as they added .com to their company name despite not knowing how to incorporate tech. That’s why so many companies failed while amazon, a company from that time worked out, its because Bezos understood tech and business."
3,2020-10-13,g8o44a2,Tristanna,investing,The gains would be so much lower. If you had a 10 year call on AMZN ten years ago you'd have had about a decade of 1.00 delta.
0,2020-10-14,g8rvwt2,begals,options,"Well, good luck to you certainly.  I'd recommend you be willing to take a substantial loss (even if it's 50-75% down) if the remaining value is meaningful to you.  Which is to say, is it worth recouping what's left or is it an inconsequential amount where I might as well write it off as a total loss which once in a blue moon might rocket back up before expiration but which I definitely don't expect to.  For me that tends to be at least-80%+, though even between -80% and -95% it's often worthwhile to get the remaining value back if I'm almost certain it's just lost money anyway.  

As an example, if my average position is worth about $4000 net value and I'm targeting an average 50% ROI, then a position that by all measures looks to be a loser is still worth closing at a loss even at 50-75% or more down, since while that's a lot, if I close down 50% that cancels out one +50% trade, if I let it go to a total loss that's twice as often I need to hit my target just to breakeven.  (Not that 50% per trade should or shouldn't be your target, it's all relative to the risk/reward profile - a +10% target is fine if I'm setup to tolerate very low risk and that can make just as much as the equally fine but more volatile circumstance where I'm hypothetically targeting 250%+ gains, in this case risk is generally pretty high and so I need my gains to compensate for losses appropriately).  Both scenarios can work, and I personally fall somewhere in the middle but with what would generally be regarded as a high risk/reward profile since generally I'm targeting between 35-150% depending on circumstance.  Even then, I'll close some iffy looking positions up 5-10% or even breakeven at times, and if something gains 300% overnight and is trending up, I'm sure as hell not selling until it there's at least some sign of resistance from the market (in a case where upward movement on the underlying is a good thing), though unless I was specifically planning a small investment, low probability, high return trade I'm still going to close out as soon as it begins to lose value for more than a minute or two or does so at an unusually quick rate.  

I should also note I primarily day trade, with 5-15 DTE so that occasionally a day trade will turn into a swing trade or I'll enter some swing trades later in the day; Trading with such little time to expiration significantly increases the inherent risk in market exposure.   If your option expires in 6 months, you don't necessarily have to make such quick decisions if it's up, as the same underlying movement that might turn a +70% position with 3 DTE into a -20% position in just 30 minutes would probably have only a -5% or so max impact on a position of the exact same structure but with 6 months til expiration.   This also should make it apparent why, pretty much across the board everyone will recommend learning on options with at least 2-3 months runway minimum.   Trading short-DTE can definitely be profitable but the risk is substantially higher, news events or presidential tweets will have a much more sizable impact, and you usually have only moments to make the right decision when managing an open position.   That is obviously stressful on its own, but it also is hard to tell what the right move was even after the fact when learning options, since it can be the right move to leave a position open even if it doesn't work out, or the right move to have closed it even if subsequently you would have seen another 200% gain.  Until you're comfortable with your analysis, there's a serious risk of making poor decisions based off feeling like you missed out on a big pay day.   Discipline matters always in options but especially so when day trading short-DTE positions and even more so when they're one-leg directional positions, which are made out to be nothing but gambling, which is usually true for retail traders but not necessarily so.  They just require that much more discipline and experience to have a good chance with.

I guess I say this because it definitely sounds like you have a lone call or put, (and probably a call purchased before around 1-1:30 EST given how you described the change in value - which also suggests you're dealing with a pretty short-DTE option and/or one significantly OTM.  In fact, since you asked about 3,490 I'd guess that's either the strike or your B/E on the underlying.  In either case, I'd recommend you understand completely what effects price, as otherwise you could be in for an unwelcome lesson about how it can be at $3500 and your position can still be down - though on the other hand, it can be at $3470 and you could be up.  It all depends on when you bought it and subsequent changes in IV etc... If you aren't familiar with this concept fully, which the question suggests because hitting 3490 is kind of a meaningless thing without a host of other conditions being met, I'd even more so urge you to take your win or loss tomorrow because even +50% can become -80% sickeningly quickly).  

For anyone really wanting to learn options and make good income, I definitely don't recommend learning in such a trial by fire unless you can take 100% loss 50 times over without being bothered.  The mental resilience to deal with losses without making poor or overly-gambly decisions as a result takes time to build up, so for most people it's far more safe and easy to limit your risk.  

Anyway that's far more than I intended to say, but hopefully that's of some use.   I definitely stand by the idea that if you'd be bothered losing 100% you should just sell on the open and not try to find a best time to sell - Timing the markets with anything more than a very rough amount of accuracy is nearly impossible and even being in the general ballpark is hard for most investors and traders.  Learn on highly optionable underlyings that are trading between $25 and $500 at the absolute max I'd say.  For something like Amazon, the underlying is so high that unless you're able to comfortably learn on a $10-50k position, you're already having to pick options that are way too far OTM and have far too few DTE to even get in on the action.  So, good luck, I hope some of my guesses are wrong but if not please do use caution and be willing to cut your losses, better to live to trade another day."

I’d put the largest portion on AMZN and the diversify between APPL and other nasdaq companies. Perhaps you may want to check QQQ and or VOO (both ETFs). 
The issue I have with AAPL (currently exploring my exit plan, since I do have some stock) is they may have reached a plateau with the iPhone. I believe they know it, and that explains their turn into becoming a digital services company. If you’re familiar with technical analysis, grab AAPL from 2009 to 2019 (both inclusive) and you’ll see the returns have varied widely. Based on the standard deviation, this signals a rather mid-high risks. 
I believe AAPPL is peaking now. If you bought shares in 2016, you have around 300% return today. It’s real, it’s great, but it’s a flag."

Now, to present the counter-argument, not only did my portfolio drop 80% during the dot-com crash, but MSFT and AMZN did NOTHING for a good ten years.  So it's not as easy as the last ten years have made it look.  You need to believe in the management and product roadmap.

Take a look at CSCO's all-time chart for a dose of reality.  The 90s were fucking amazing. 
 I made so much money off CSCO.  And then it's been a dog since the dot-com crash.  So you need to be objective about when a company has lost its edge.

The question really is, what *can't* Amazon displace? And can it grow so large that it gets broken up? Congress may be that ""act of God"" that the bulls aren't prepared to deal with."

Its in the past. Unless you were invested before this moment it means nothing. Someone else commented, past gains are no guarantee of the future growth lol. Yes Amazon is on a massive track to keep growing but nothing is ever set in stone. I'm sure Ford, GM, and all the legacy carmakers thought the same before Tesla. What I'm getting at is - Amazon can only grow SO large before the tank runs out and theres no more growth. Bezos himself  acknowledges that over and over. 

“I predict one day Amazon will fail. Amazon will go bankrupt.” - Jeff Bezos

""Amazon is not too big to fail,” Bezos said, in a recording of the meeting that CNBC has heard. “In fact, I predict one day Amazon will fail. Amazon will go bankrupt. If you look at large companies, their lifespans tend to be 30-plus years, not a hundred-plus years.” - Nov 15, 2018

The world's richest man understands it, so why dont simple investors? 

How many years would you say Amazon has left before they peak and stop ""growing"" ..? (Serious question)"

8,2020-10-13,g8nuuyo,The_Texidian,stocks,"> Why not? Is something going to replace phones? If new tech comes along, Apple just upgrades its phones.

Because, as u/BenevolentMachine said, new phones come out. Technology moves fast. Apple and other companies also have the problem....people don’t buy new phones every year, most people hold onto their phones for a few years before buying a new one, this makes new phone sales hard to predict and grow. 

Anyway, you can see how Apple is 

A) Trying to keep people in the Apple atmosphere 

And B) Trying to find new revenue streams. 

Apple has been pushing the Apple watch a lot as a fitness item to compete with Fitbit. Apple has been pushing Apple Music now to compete with Spotify. Apple as been making their own music listening devices and so on. Apple even came out with their own Apple credit card that links up with your phone. All of this is to try to get people to buy more apple products so all their devices are linked together. Apple Music and Apple TV also create a monthly revenue source as well. 

From what I can tell, Apple is trying to become more like amazon and do multiple things. Such as health care and entertainment. I can only see apple growing such ventures in the future. 

If Apple were to rely only on phones they’d have to 

A) Increase the price of the phone

B) Sell more of their phones to more people."

The only thing I don't like about Amazon is that it's kind of maxed out. It's position as one of, if not the, most dominant companies in the world is obvious. So, a lot of money gets pumped into its stock based simply on its dominance, and its position in funds, etc. There isn't an incredibly logical reason why it is near $3500 now instead of $2000, which it was relatively recently, or sub $1000 which it also was not so long ago.

What I do usually is directly copy and paste code an entry from the Kindle version of this book:

https://www.amazon.com/Entry-Exit-Confessions-Champion-Trader-ebook/dp/B07R8LZ4Z2/ref=nodl_

I first find an entry that is symmetrical, meaning it can stand alone as a strategy without an exit. I then try to create as many variations of the entry as possible. So:
 
Stoplosses: no stop, atr stop, dollar amount stop

Volatility filter: only trade when low volatility, only trade during high volatility, no volatility filter

Trend filter: require close>average(close,xbars), require close<average(close,xbars), no trend filter
 
I test all these combinations on about 20 symbols of my choosing.

Then you can do the reverse of the entry where you change buy to sellshort and sellshort to buy. Doing this doubles the amount of unique strategy combinations.

With just 1 entry that’s a lot of combinations, not even including combining exits. Each combination is a unique strategy.

This explains the concept much better:

1. Personally I'm not entirely sure that the loss of internet and then mobile are not a direct path from the antitrust. IE was the most dominant browser for 15-20 years as Netscape didn't last all that long, and the hole that allowed for other browsers to rise did come from the antitrust. Firefox and Chrome got an opening from there, which seems to have also contributed to the purchase and development of the Android OS, launching Google into relevance in the internet era. That they were also better helped of course but it does seem like the kernel is possibly linked to the browser wars of the late 90s that IE won but from which FF was launched.

2. Microsoft has gone through tons of attempts to innovate as have Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon, of which few have worked - which the author points out. However, Microsoft still has a *near-monopoly* in the enterprise productivity suite (365), where Google has barely made inroads with Docs other than to view a Microsoft document or spreadsheet. Their shift to the cloud and the success of Azure are pretty sufficiently innovative. 

**I'd argue that it seems like they sold the OS thanks to the business suite and not vice versa**. The business suite has always been their real monopoly and it's getting stronger. The OS and browsers were perks of the success of the suite. Now that microsoft is platform-agnostic for its suite, it's having more success than it did before. That's pretty cool. I wonder if Apple will ever go through the same realization seeing as the iPhone is continuously losing market share. 

Just as an aside, with all this in mind, the author's skeptical of breakups in the article but it seems like the companies do have more success when they are more platform-agnostic than a closed loop."

Once you are a margin account you are always a margin account. Once you are a PDT you are always a PDT. You have to jump through some hops to change back down to a cash account. Now lets run through a quick example.

Cash Value account : $30,000

Margin Value with above account : Cash value $30,000 + margin $60,000 = $90000

If this account is PDT depends on how you trade. More than 3 ""I think"" same day trades in a rolling 5 trading day span auto converts you to a PDT account.

\-Trade 1 : 100 shares of MSFT at $150 = $15,000 ==== $5000 against your cash and $10,000 on margin. Cash value in your account is now $25000.

With that trade because your TOTAL shares are valued below you $30k cash value you do not get charged margin interest.

\-Trade 2 ""while holding trade 1 still"" : 1000 shares of PENN at $13 = $13000 ==== $4300ish against your cash and $8600 on margin. Cash value in your account is now $21000.

So with the 2 trades above you have roughly $27000 worth of stocks. However your Cash value is $30000 so you do not get charged margin interest.

\-Trade 3 ""while still holding trade 1 and 2"" : 10 shares of AMZN at $2400 = $24000 === $8000 against your cash and $16000 on margin. Cash Value in your account is now $13000

HOWEVER you now have $15k + $13k + $24k = $42k worth of stock so $12000 on loan from your broker. You get charged margin interest on $12k PER DAY! So with E-Trade that is 8% so with some quick ""probably wrong"" math we get

$12000 \* .8 = $960

$960 / 360 ""360 why they calc 360 and not 365 I do not know"" = $2.66

So to borrow $12000 is $2.66 per day. Really not to bad but can get out of hand REAL fast. get stuck in a trade that you ate shit on and then the stock gets a halt like Linkin Coffee and you are paying interest to not even be able to trade and take the fucking lose.

Happy trading sir!

p.s - to answer one of your questions directly. No you can not pick and choose how to spend the money in your account. Once a margin account you are buying on margin. Just dont buy more than your cash value :)"

Part of the internet already shut down this summer, and nobody would've noticed if they couldn't get onto Amazon, GTA: Online, etc. Going into Google, Bing, etc, was normal. I used to be a Shit Hits The Fan moron up until a few years ago, and with this pandemic, I've realized how truly retarded those people are. You don't need a map to go to the grocery store you've been going to for years. You're writing about nothing, because for the most part, China would only be hurting themselves. Not just for accessing their own assets, but internationally, and even if there was some kind of MAD, we have the strategic advantage, because we are all over the fucking planet, because... reasons."
2,2020-10-15,g8x2meo,cobymoby,stocks,"I was long on this stock.  once I started reading more into hyliions claims, much of it is hopelessly optimistic, some of it is downright incorrect.  I don’t believe this company will achieve levels of drivetrain dominance that Detroit or cummins has in the class 8 truck market.  The cost of natural gas would have to somehow come down by 50% to 60% once their flagship product (erx fully electric drivetrain) hits the market.

this is NOT a Nikola scam company.  they are legit but its just not the next amazon/tesla/etc that many are hoping it to be. 


I sold for a massive loss.  lesson learned."

Regarding good stocks to get, Amazon, amd, nvidia, cloudflare, square are all solid choices. If you're looking for an ETF, definitely put some money into IShares Global Clean Energy ETF, it's got great companies, and clean energy is the future yo, its only up from here. Other than that, for ultimate security you could put a portion into the s&p. :)"
