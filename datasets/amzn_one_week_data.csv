It won’t get better than that and it shouldn’t. It will be a lot safer if the robot drove and everyone supervised the robot. All the benefits with even less risk. That’s what I predict. So you can forget about working on a laptop while driving.. that’s a distant fantasy, will be illegal, and will absolve the manufacturer of all liability if an accident happens. In other words: Amazon, Uber, Lyft, etc., their dream of the employee-less employee is a fantasy, it will be legislated out of possibility, for the safety of others, as well as to protect employees."

They were ahead of the game when it came to COVID-19 mitigation, and their sales have only gotten BETTER during the pandemic, despite their e-commerce footprint being relatively small compared to Walmart, Amazon, etc. 

Their app could use improvements but I think the company has more growth to come for sure. Can you imagine if they had curbside pickup? It’d be a wrap"
2,2020-10-10,g8bncf1,TheBigBingo,investing,"Problem is a lot of the M2 supply that was created is essentially trapped in the capital markets. With the Fed buying corporate bonds and treasuries to keep rates low, the theory is that this encourages companies to expand, thus pulling through to wage increases. Over this years, this has not played. M2 velocity has been slowly decreasing (until its most recent large drop) and the supply of money that’s been increasing essentially goes to inflating equity prices - debt refinancing, stock buybacks, dividends, etc... and inflated home prices through low mortgage rates. Until there is a shift from capital to more of a labor centric corporate strategy, wages will remain more stagnant which will keep velocity down, thus hampering inflation. As an analogy goes, if I create $1T and just put it in a safe, never to be used, then it doesn’t affect the system. That’s essentially what the Fed has done. It’s affecting the credit system but not flowing through to product consumption. If inflation does start to creep into the market, then equities will only benefit. Top-lines will grow along with their earnings. If there is a high inflation environment, then it will tend more to a capital strategy where companies continue their buybacks and different things in order to outpace inflation on a return basis for shareholders and it won’t funnel through to wages as much. Wages will end up increase but will more than likely lag inflation since corporations will be needing to outpace on equity prices. 

The scarier scenario for equities is deflation which is possible in our current environment. If consumer spending doesn’t pick back up, you’ll continue a “K shaped” style recovery where “pandemic winners” (e.g Amazon) will see continued appreciation as investors consolidate in those companies while leaving pandemic losers such as airlines."
3,2020-10-10,g8ayzkw,WittyFault,investing,"BLUF:  You don't seem knowledgeable about AI technology.  I would avoid using any notions you have of understanding AI as a basis for investing.  Some specific point:

>From what I read, it is hard to do complex AI technology. 

I would think it is **hard** to do anything **complex**.  That just seems like defining terms.

>If you look at the successful AI technology today: Self driving by TESLA ... it is the extremely simple AI technology that is done at an incredibly fast pace 

Self driving is actually one of (if not the) most complex AI technologies being heavily funded today.  


>More recently, the most successful complex AI technology story is Tik Tok

Painting TikTok as an AI company is giving them way too much credit.  TikTok is a social media company... key to social media company is network effects not some magical AI.  


>Tik tok search AI is vastly superior to anything in the US at this time.

Is that true?  Is TikTok search better than Google?  Tik Tok ""search AI"" is very similar to Netflix AI, Youtube AI, Facebook AI, Amazon AI, etc.  It is a recommendation engine.   

Microsoft wanted it because that is the core of TikTok... that is where advertisers/users are connected and where the valuable data flows.  If you don't own that, you are essentially an app store front for TikTok.  


>My question is Lemonade insurance claims using Complex AI technology to detect fraud. Is this true?

Sure they are using AI to detect fraud.  Here is a secret, every other insurance company out there is using AI to detect fraud to some degree.  Go to Indeed and search ""data scientist insurance"" and you will see a long list of insurance companies hiring Masters/PhDs for machine learning jobs.


Also, this isn't a very ""complex"" application of AI.  The hardest part of real world AI is the data.  Insurance companies have a very good set of data that is already human curated with the appropriate outcome.


>I find it unlikely that Lemonade has achieved this. If they have, they are worth their stock price for sure. 

What analysis have you done to support their current stock price?"

1,2020-10-11,g8hhkr0,CaptainCanuck93,investing,"I see a few. Every expansion outside Nicaragua surges the stock price, I think diversification will eventually work. But I think more likely we will either see a partnership on one of the big pipeline projects (ex the Amazonas plant that would dwarf Nicaragua's production) with Brookfield or a straight up acquisition from BEP will eventually take this one off the market. Their valuation is too attractive to stay this way forever, and the team implied that Brookfield (who is financing the Panama expansion) is keen to keep working with PIF"
2,2020-10-11,g8gixk8,__TSLA__,investing,">Coal is in its death throe for sure. It's almost game over. 

>But renewables are not stopping here as their cost keeps falling. Once enough battery storage becomes available, it's only a matter of time before NG falls as well.

Energy is a stupendous large addressable market of well over a trillion dollars of revenue per year, and much of it is still fossil fuel dominated.

So the disruption is both huge and unavoidable - hence the growth premiums for renewable stocks.

The growth of Apple, Google & Amazon will seem like a child's play."

Well, maybe this move makes a market for independent film distribution on some streaming network. Amazon has promoted independent publishing through Kindle. Maybe Amazon can also promote independent filmmakers through Prime Video."
2,2020-10-13,g8nv5ys,Monir5265,investing,"That’s true and it’s a risk that can’t be brushed off easily. My reasoning is that after watching all of Chamath palihapitiya interviews, it seems to me like he truly understands tech and business. Some of the “cloud and AI” companies today are often led by a management team who doesn’t understand tech. Same thing happened in 99 where ceos saw how stocks rose as soon as they added .com to their company name despite not knowing how to incorporate tech. That’s why so many companies failed while amazon, a company from that time worked out, its because Bezos understood tech and business."

you must live in a country with low inflation. Please go try to live in a one of the many countries with double digit inflation. You also may have more freedom in your country to bring other currencies in and out of the country, consider some do not have this liesure and the citizens who fly out and come back with physical gold end up with it confinscated.
