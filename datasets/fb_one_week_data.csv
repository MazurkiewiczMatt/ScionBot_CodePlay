This is nowhere near accurate. YouTube definitely incorporates autoplay events into the recommendation & search engine and Facebook/Instagram uses scroll tracking to identify a pause to view an item in your feed, regardless of engagement. Just two simple examples of many.

TikTok made their recommendation engine the primary component of their interface. That doesn't mean it's collecting more activity data."

2,2020-10-10,g8ayzkw,WittyFault,investing,"BLUF:  You don't seem knowledgeable about AI technology.  I would avoid using any notions you have of understanding AI as a basis for investing.  Some specific point:

>From what I read, it is hard to do complex AI technology. 

I would think it is **hard** to do anything **complex**.  That just seems like defining terms.

>If you look at the successful AI technology today: Self driving by TESLA ... it is the extremely simple AI technology that is done at an incredibly fast pace 

Self driving is actually one of (if not the) most complex AI technologies being heavily funded today.  


>More recently, the most successful complex AI technology story is Tik Tok

Painting TikTok as an AI company is giving them way too much credit.  TikTok is a social media company... key to social media company is network effects not some magical AI.  


>Tik tok search AI is vastly superior to anything in the US at this time.

Is that true?  Is TikTok search better than Google?  Tik Tok ""search AI"" is very similar to Netflix AI, Youtube AI, Facebook AI, Amazon AI, etc.  It is a recommendation engine.   

Microsoft wanted it because that is the core of TikTok... that is where advertisers/users are connected and where the valuable data flows.  If you don't own that, you are essentially an app store front for TikTok.  


>My question is Lemonade insurance claims using Complex AI technology to detect fraud. Is this true?

Sure they are using AI to detect fraud.  Here is a secret, every other insurance company out there is using AI to detect fraud to some degree.  Go to Indeed and search ""data scientist insurance"" and you will see a long list of insurance companies hiring Masters/PhDs for machine learning jobs.


Also, this isn't a very ""complex"" application of AI.  The hardest part of real world AI is the data.  Insurance companies have a very good set of data that is already human curated with the appropriate outcome.


>I find it unlikely that Lemonade has achieved this. If they have, they are worth their stock price for sure. 

What analysis have you done to support their current stock price?"

I don’t use TikTok so I don’t know. Is this AI really that much better than YouTube recommendations, Netflix recommendations, Facebook newsfeed algorithms, Instagram explore tab?"
