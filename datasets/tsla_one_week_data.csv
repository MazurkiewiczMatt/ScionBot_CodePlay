All the analysts chase stock price, which is why you see analysts raining TSLA price target to $550. I mean, where were they when TSLA was sitting at $40  (split adjusted) an year ago?

Second, look at the TAM and leadership teams. Fastly is run by a stellar leadership team. Fiverr has a good CEO so both are comparable in that aspect. If I had to choose, I will choose FVRR because of little competition from Upwork. Upwork is a poor product. On the other hand, Fastly has legitimate competition from NET and so even though FSLY will continue to innovate, NET will keep them on their feet and give them a run for their money. 

FSLY is personally my second largest position after Sea Limited but I would still prefer Fiverr because the stock is considerably cheaper than Fastly right now (on eval basis)."

>Autopilot is driving 99% better than humans on roads that it is supposed to be driven on

See now you're moving the goalpost. I know tesla shows autopilot statistics and as you say people probably only turn it on in situation where they know it can perform good enough. Which mostly is highway driving or linear roads. This is the type of roads where you really only need to maintain your speed and follow the lane lines, a technology that already exists since the 90s even without the use of DL. 

So then what does 99% better mean? Are you proposing it means better in situation where it is already better? Then that's a very misleading claim no? This thread is not talking about what tesla is or isn't capable on doing right now. It's about general level 5 full self driving."
6,2020-10-11,g8hl6pl,Alilttotheleft,investing,"Agreed. They’ve already updated the computers from the ones in the earliest FSD versions once or twice and will have to retrofit those later to keep their promise. Reeeeeeeally over promised on that early on. 

I’d be curious to learn more about what gets sent back if you have a source somewhere. I’ll do some searching myself, too. Elon has mentioned several times that future versions or changes in Autopilot are run in shadow mode adjacent to the current running version so it can validate decisions and learn from driver input and what’s going on around the car while in its current version. I assumed a lot of that stuff went back to Tesla, but it could all just be local machine learning."

9,2020-10-11,g8hksis,Alilttotheleft,investing,"I don’t doubt for a second that they’re going at this in the hardest way possible... but I think it’s also the most complete solution as instead of relying on precision mapping that is impossible to keep 100% up to date (see GM’s Supercruise) it’s teaching the cars how to react, identify objects, etc, through machine learning. It’s definitely the most challenging implementation, but IF they can make it work it’ll likely be the most powerful one. Autopilot is already the best driver assistant on the road and getting better all the time - Tesla’s so far ahead on that stuff at this point that every day it seems a little more likely to me that Elon was right on this one. Just my opinion, natch.

As for the LIDAR comment - sure, I believe it can be done with cameras only. But in these early stages of development and until it is perfected I think LIDAR could add a lot of valuable data and accuracy to the system. Or, if they wanted to implement it permanently moving forward LIDAR would be a fantastic backup tool for validating Tesla Vision while in use. Just because I think they can do it with cameras doesn’t mean I don’t have concerns around the accuracy and reliability of everything, especially this early in development. So long as the car’s computer can handle the input more information so it can make better decisions will always be a good thing."

11,2020-10-11,g8e6cgb,ObservationalHumor,investing,"Tesla's system hit a truck because it relied super heavily on their front radar array which has garbage vertical resolution.  As a result they heavily filtered it and decided the truck was a static object like an overpass or sign gantry.  Their vision system was dogshit at the time and identified the truck as part of the sky line.  Most of these systems are nowhere near as comprehensive or accurate as you seem to think, they're getting better but they're probabalistic estimators by design and their thresholds for intervention are closer to 65-70% than 99.999999% and you don't even find accuracy numbers that high for basic tasks for object recognition and depth estimation in cutting edge academic research most of the time.  Really that's a ridiculous number given that farm simpler tasks with far more complex consensus models don't even achieve that kind of accuracy.  For Tesla's system specifically they don't a vision based depth field estimator currently, train on video data or prestitched panoramas of their camera feed to deal well with objects moving between them.  Their actual highway TACC systems still suffer from problems like phantom breaking and properly detecting static road side obstacles specifically because they lean so heavily on their front radar array which just has terrible vertical resolution.  Their smart summon system is basically a two ton Roomba at this point too.

They're supposed to be doing a big rewrite to actually approach the problem in a sane say instead of everything being bolted onto their radar heavy TACC system but even that they're hyping as ""zero intervention"" some of the time.  None of this crap is even the hard stuff though like ascertaining the intent of pedestrians, cyclists and deriving a good structural and semantic understanding of things like intersections or other crossings.

Waymo's system should be better specifically because they're willing to use additional sensor suites (primarily LIDAR) and HD maps which provide a good expectation for what the ground truth should look like.  Even then it's taken them years to get things working in one town in Arizona under close to ideal driving conditions.

Maybe in 5-10 years we see Waymo get things portable enough or do enough mapping to transition their system to a major metro area where they can potentially make money off a robotaxi service in good weather, but that's about as optimistic as I'm willing to be personally.  There's also a huge problem here with there being no real formal verification or indepedent testing process for pretty much any FSD system currently let alone a comprehensive regulatory framework that at least provides some assurances of safety, functionality and redundancy.  Half of these half baked and completely immature systems are operating on roadways specifically because the NTHSA and state regulators have basically shrugged their shoulders even trying to regulate it currently."

I’ve driven most of the modern driver assist programs and Autopilot to me feels to be the most complete and most effective solution out there at the moment.

Sure, Waymo is testing in a special area that is very controlled, very small, where not much will happen. They can keep the road layout in memory and in sync with real time (with probably the city planners in touch with them regularly to cover for road work or any change).

Although, it is a city, and can handle many edge cases. It is still only a small percentage in terms of the real world and the vast majority of edge cases. Phoenix is nice in terms of weather, not much rain, snow, wind, heavy traffic, etc. Not many deers crossing, not many mattresses in the middle of the highway. Etc...

Today, I can still lock a self driving car with two card boxes. One in front and one in back. Car would not be able to move.

Numbers from Tesla should not be interpreted at face value, they have a huge selection bias. They compare against the administration numbers (1 accident per 500k miles in average, Tesla is around 1 acc per 4m miles), so it is bound to be much better. An average car is worth $10k, versus $50k to $100k for Tesla. Not the same customers, not the same behavior, not the same location, or care. It shows with the rate for Tesla without autopilot or safety in, which is around 1 acc by 1.3m miles. (So de facto, Tesla customers will have 2.5x less accident - selection bias). Now you compare 4m against this 1.3m (or 2.2m with safety on), and auto-pilot is twice as safe. Well, except that auto-pilot is only enabled in easy mode, highways, where it is easy to add many miles to the numbers. The harder mode, where all the edge cases are, is bound to have more accidents, and not have as many miles at a time. A lot of small drives will statistically increase the number of accidents (most accidents are few miles from where you live because that’s where you drive the most, but you would not and could not enable autopilot there)."

Is that true?  Is TikTok search better than Google?  Tik Tok ""search AI"" is very similar to Netflix AI, Youtube AI, Facebook AI, Amazon AI, etc.  It is a recommendation engine.   

Microsoft wanted it because that is the core of TikTok... that is where advertisers/users are connected and where the valuable data flows.  If you don't own that, you are essentially an app store front for TikTok.

Sure they are using AI to detect fraud.  Here is a secret, every other insurance company out there is using AI to detect fraud to some degree.  Go to Indeed and search ""data scientist insurance"" and you will see a long list of insurance companies hiring Masters/PhDs for machine learning jobs.


Also, this isn't a very ""complex"" application of AI.  The hardest part of real world AI is the data.  Insurance companies have a very good set of data that is already human curated with the appropriate outcome.

As we transition to renewables, we will start to realise how unreliable they are and how destructive they are to our immediate environment. California is having brownouts because the renewable energy supply they are hellbent on transitioning to just doesn’t stand up to the fossil fuel supply. Renewables are more expensive than we think, cause more damage than we think, and are made and maintained from entirely in unrenewable materials and processes.

Another thing.. passenger cars make up just 6% of our co2 emissions. If we transition to EV’s, we are not reducing our co2 emissions.. we are actually increasing them because we emit more co2 through the generation of the electricity used to charge these EV’s than we do through the use of internal combustion engines. We are not getting rid of the problem, we are just moving it back down the production line and magnifying it.

WTI will lose value because the public believe oil is bad. The pressure the leftist are putting on companies like BP to go green are forcing them to make these outrageous targets that will ultimately kill their business. This will increase the price of Brent oil in the long term.

I’m not sure how V2G will do anything productive. It allows you to sell the electricity stored in your car’s battery back to the grid.. well now you have no car to drive. 

You will need a constant supply of copper, silver, nickel, iron ore and uranium if you want clean energy (plus many more rare earth metals). You will need coal, oil and gas to mine, transport and manufacture the equipment required to produce this “renewable” energy. This equipment will require a constant supply of these metals for maintenance and replacements.

So over the next, let’s say, 10 years for argument sake. You’re going to see a reduction in the supply of gas, oil, and coal as we use them to mine the materials needed for this supposedly “green” revolution we are heading toward. This will increase the price of these commodities. After 10 years the public may realise that renewables aren’t actually that renewable and that the science and maths behind anthropogenic climate change doesn’t quite make sense anymore.. and we will shift back to our reliance on coal, oil and gas.. which the world absolutely relies on. Which will increase the demand and therefore the price.

Tesla’s batteries are good if you need to supply a few thousand homes for a couple of hours.. not the entirety of Europe, the factories and the electric cars forever..

Again.. buy rare earth metals and commodities while they are cheap. Is it so hard to believe the politicians are lying to you? Do you really think all these Russian and Middle Eastern oil tycoons are investing in Tesla and Google? Or are they investing in mining companies and commodities? Who wins at the end of all this? The public or the elites?

Yes, politicians goals are too ambitious but at least it shows the direction the world wants to go. But it certainly will take longer than 10 years. 

I don't see how the UK would need the global output of copper just to upgrade their grid? You have a source for this? Especially if EVs are used intelligently with V2G they stabilise the grid and decrease the need for grid upgrades

Temporary local environment damage from mining is a much much smaller price to pay than lasting global climate change with potentially catastrophic outcome. Also, cobalt isn't need any longer for batteries. And energy for mining is not a problem when the machines are electric which is produced by renewables.

People sometimes get me wrong. I can believe renewables should serve as much of global energy consumption as possible, and think that's a good thing to tackle climate change. Whether I think investing in renewable companies is a good idea is another issue entirely.

I've invested in commodity companies in the past and never again.

There's no reason for consumers to choose one energy company over another - the output is homogenous so they have no control of pricing of product.

All they can do is increase efficiency by cutting costs to raise profits.

Every energy company does that and it's a never ending race to the bottom.

That's not a great business model.

The renewable companies in USA aren't making any profit and have poor margins.

People hate on Tesla for being overvalued but it actually produces a value added product rather than a commodity or low value add solar installation/ maintenance.

And in vehicles like Priuses or Tesla's, swapping out batteries is a task that takes a meaningful amount of time because of how embedded their batteries are. 

If a battery swap station has to keep 10 proprietary types of battery on hand to service potentially 200 (low ball) vehicles per day at 10-30 minutes per battery swap, that's a lot of staff, a lot of real estate, and most importantly in my mind, a huge buy in on the part of the service station/manufacturer.

It's tricky, if your car is 30k and the batteries are 20k of that, you don't want to swap out your new battery for a used one. So, you'd need a contract with one company. You need consistency across brands -- right now I can fill up my gas car at any gas station, I don't need to go find my brand of battery swapping.

So, maybe you get one brand that takes over? Or you get swapping stations that carry multiple brands and you show up hoping they have one in stock for you?

Tesla's already priced bigger than all the other car manufacturers, so... not obvious you make money even if they take over all the car business.

I agree with your point but I believe what will happen is the big box chains like Walmart will roll out chargers in their parking lots for charging while shopping, and that will cover most suburban areas.

Urban areas without much parking will probably have to be implemented by the municipalities themselves because they own the majority of the parking. But I could see them giving a parking meter type contract to a company like Chargepoint to implement it for them. Probably with a smaller up front payment to fund manufacture but not a direct sale like they would normally do.

I'm still long oil companies for the foreseeable future though. I think it'll take a minimum of 5-10 years to fully roll out electric charging. Longer to convert most consumers to new cars."

I drove cross country, this summer. Gasoline is great -- go 400 miles, refuel in 5 minutes, keep driving. Is CA gonna install charging stations across the country, that recharge my car in 5 minutes?

Maybe there's green tech I don't know about. But I'm a big skeptic that oil's gonna die that fast. The California law doesn't even cover heavy trucks, which are even harder to electrify.

I think, oil demand is way down from covid. US and Europe go back most of the way to normal by end of 2021 with a vaccine. Developed world keeps growing for a while, uses simple older technologies. Oil is flat or growing for another 10 years, at least, before long term decline.

Natural gas should probably keep growing for a few decades, as it complements intermittent green power.

Where's that leave stocks? I doubt exxon stays at 35. Not sure if it ever goes back to 80, though.

Good for you. Go buy TSLA then. BTW, bitcoin outperformed tesla in the last decade (2010-2019) by something absurd, like over 10,000%.
